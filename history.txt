Add atmosphere reflections to vessels
Add atmosphere reflections to vessels
Atmosphere reflections were added for reflection rays which do not intersect the planet (we don't have a good way to do planet reflections yet).
This is only enabled when the vessel is inside the atmosphere as when it exits the atmosphere, the atmosphere lut produces incorrect rainbow colors (this is something I'm currently debugging). This means that the atmosphere color is attenuated to zero as we exit the atmosphere.
The stars are also disabled when reflection rays intersect the planet inside the atmosphere, as they look weird if enabled here. The stars are enabled for all reflection angles when we exit the atmosphere.
Fixed a crash when collapsing the map UI menu.
Simplify the BRUTAL package reference
Added build process handling so that discord version messages and other webhook payloads will be prepared by the build server, so that this process can be automated.

The stars are enabled for all reflection angles when we exit the atmosphere.
Add commented out aerial lut code. An experiment was done with aerial lut sampling when intersecting the planet, but there are bugs with the way the aerial lut works, so the code was commented out until I hear back from Ghassen.
Rename "getPBRLighitngLo" to "getPBRLightingDirect".
Migrated master server URI to new system to handle launch differently from version checking.
Added Support for a sounds pitch or volume to be changed according to distance, velocity, or a custom parameter. This is authored by adding a Param Element to the soundRefernceData.
Added toward, away, and align tracking targets for the TGT frame. After testing, I realize that target pointing and docking alignment are actually two different frames because of the vastly different frame rotation rates, so I will need to split these in a follow-on commit.
Refactored version checking so that it is non-allocating.
Switch BRDF texture to RGBA8. This solves a crash occurring when it was in RG8 format.
Delete old stars texture
Vehicle sound now always plays based on the base camera location. This means engine sounds will keep playing even in map view.
Clamp minimum input throttle to the minimum of all engine throttles.
Preserve engine input settings in save games.
Revert BRDF texture to RG format as the issue was git lfs
Preserve navball frame in save games.
Actually serialize out engine inputs, don't just read them in.
Delete old commented out shader code from Atmosphere.comp
Tidy occlusionColor code in vessel shader. The code has been made more clear that the occlusionColor is the atmosphere transmission color from the sun.
Refactored SoundReference to abstract the Fmod sound file wrapper behaviour into the SoundFileReference class. This allows all sound behaviours to inherit from the same abstract class and moves the file handling portion into its own class. This will allow for different sound playback behaviours (i.e. layered, random or compound sounds) to be authored via xml and be triggered in the same generic way.
Added Support for Custom Parameters on SoundBehaviours.
Added Engine volume and pitch now changes based on Throttle parameter
Split rendering logic out of subpart.
Split editor/thrust editor logic out of orbit controller.
Started preliminary work to convert Gemini to parts.
Changed some verbiage for follow vs view in the map mode menu.
Changed FlightPlan to require a vehicle Id. This can then be used to check against closest approach targets to ensure we do not calculate closest approach against ourselves.
Added Iequatable methods to Orbit class to more efficiently check for Equals on Orbit instances.
Changed Target to be an IOrbiting rather than a Celestial to allow us to set Vehicles as targets.
Changed Encounter to also be an IOrbiting rather than a celestial for the same reason.
Renamed PorkChopTask worker task to TransferTask to better reflect what this worker task actually does.
Changed the TranferPlanner UI to allow selection of Vehicles as the target.

Changed initial assignment of ThrottleUp and ThrottleDown temporarily, as its assignment caused conflict with modifiers. This is a temporary change, which will be iterated on later design wise.
Added first pass of moveable with mouse option for gauges, using the Gauge UI debug. Previously, gauges could be moved by clicking on a component and editing the values in the table. Now they can also be edited by enabling "moveable" and then moving with a mouse. This then needs to be copied into XML. This makes modding/making gauge items easier. Needs a lot of cleanup and quality of life.
Changed visibility of Burn UI to always display regardless of distance for the currently controlled vehicle.
Added gauge rect editing. This allows drag and resize for rect instances of a gauge, meaning that instance placement can be done using the mouse.
Added copy to clipboard button to gauge editor, this copies the current component as XML to the clipboard.
Added clicking on a label of a gauge component int he gauge editor will copy the core data to XML, useful if doing gauge editing but you don't want to paste the full component.
Fixed gauge rect component Z and W editing would not be applied as the Width and Height from XML load were overwriting it.

Tweaked the sun bloom effects to be more subtle. Further changes and balancing to come.
Migrated the warp to next Imgui to be a button on the periapsis and apoapsis gauge objects. When clicked, they will toggle the warp on and off for that event. Needs some optimization, as hopefully we can cache the orbit values for these on the workers as it won't change during the frame.

Tweaked global bloom values to work better with the default tonemapper.
Tweaked sun flare settings to work better for varying distances and be less blinding in the map view.
Add buffer offset alignment variables to Utils.cs. The "MinUniformBufferOffsetAlignment" and "MinStorageBufferOffsetAlignment" have long variable names to access, so it is convenient to store them in Rendering/Utils.cs.
Replace "MinStorageBufferOffsetAlignment" variable with Utils variable

Show an alert when manual vehicle controls do not respond due to high warp factor.
Permit throttle down and maine engine cutoff no matter the current warp factor.

Added pitch and volume variance to rcs sound.
Fixed pitch variance not being applied.
Added ability to toggle followed vessel, it's parent and target orbits only on and off to the View menu.
New ToNearest for time reference displays. Sequentially moves through display instead of based on modularly stickying to a time. For example: Old behavior on a countdown would show ["8 days", "1 week", "6 days"]. New Behavior is ["8 days", "7 days", "6 days"]. I also added a couple decimal places, which could use some tuning if needed. Old behavior is kept under ToNearest2 for perhaps different use cases.
Added gauge screw instances for use with gauge panels. Not functional, but provides visual difference on panels used with gauges.
Fixed warp button for burn would not show state, and when clicked would not toggle, just set. Now toggling it will toggle warp to burn on and off.
Added a simplistic buoyancy calculation to the physics simulation. Ocean surfaces now support splashdown and apply drag.
Added a simple predictor sphere to help determine when objects might interact with each other.
Added density to oceans.
Added basic support for multiple meshes in a single gltf/glb file. New XML keyword of 'Gltf' (to be expanded in functionality as needed). The Id given to each submesh is based on the name of the mesh in the Gltf file which will need to be set in whatever program you're using to export the gltf/glb. I have an idea for optionally overwriting these Ids in XML with some sort of key/value pairing to make it a bit easier to modify but it seems out of scope for now.
Removed fake tangent data being sent to our PBR shaders as none of our current meshes support it and no one seems to be using it. Can re-add if/when needed.
Removed some now defunct assets.
Added anti-relative-velocity flight computer tracking target.
Changed so target markers are only drawn for the target of the followed vehicle.
Changed porkchop to no longer center on the optimal transfer window. Instead it now shows a synodic Period from the current time. Which should cover the optimal transfer time, and allows for earlier transfer selection on the porkchop.
Changed the porkchop worker to now calculate the full flightplan including potentially invalid transfers that impact the parent body. This does slow down the worker task a little bit. But it now means we can eliminate invalid transfers.
Changed the porkchop texture to show black pixels for invalid transfers (Where the transfer impacts the parent body before the closest approach).
Changed Same SOI transfers to no longer calculate Hohmann transfers. Instead it calculates Lambert transfers and displays a porkchop for them as well.
Fixed issue where same SOI transfers calculated by the transfer planner to a lower orbit were actually going outwards instead of inwards.
Fixed synodic period calculation in PatchedConics class.
Changed rendering of closest approach and aN dN markers to target to be the same colour as the orbit line they are relative to.
Added PatchedConics.TryFindEncounter to find an encounter by matching Astronomical Id.
Removed the debug Best Closest Approach, Best dV, overall Best buttons in the transfer planner as these no longer make sense, nor are they required any more.
Added Intercept Velocity (Relative speed between vehicle and target) to the Transfer Planner UI for the currently selected porkchop entry.
Removed the Show Orbits toggle in the transfer planner UI as this can now be done via the View menu.
Fixed issue where Show Selected Transfer was checked on in the Transfer Window it was not automatically showing the closest approach to the Selected Destination. It will now show this without having to set the target to the destination.
Fixed the aN and dN lines colour to match the starting orbit and now the text colour.
Fixed it so you can't set your target to yourself.
Major refactor of gauge binding system. New DistanceUnit now packs the value to allow better support for other units, such as CM, AU, and LY with smart switching between them.
Added first pass of Target Control panel. This shows data based on selected target, such as relative velocity and distance, as well as the buttons required to configure the autopilot for this. Some rework required for the panel itself.
Significantly improved burn compute engine cutoff accuracy, especially at high time warp. Previously, neither the engine burn duration in the sim nor the burn computer wakeup time were being properly respected.
Transition to null rotation when burns automatically cut off to reduce wasted RCS propellant.
When changing vehicle region, only automatically change navball frame or camera mode if the current modes matched the current region modes. This should reduce the number of unexpected transitions.
Fix an error where burns would not stay armed when loading saves.
Added additional unit (gigameter) to gauge handling to better bridge between KM and AU.
Integrated Closest approach data with the rendezvous control panel.

a fall-off of sunpower (for sun flare/bloom only) based on distance (via screenspace sun radius) with min/max settings. There is a new debug parameter that controls the exponent of that power falloff. Two other important parameters for tweaking appear in sunbloom.frag "radiusToStartScaling" controls the timing of the start of fade and "maxReduction" controls the maximum power of the reduction
Fixed Transfer Planner not resetting when the set orbit debug is UI is used.
Fixed screen resizes not being applied to all viewport cameras.
Small fix for shadow map buffer alignment
Fixed set target not setting IsTarget on the targeted astronomical. Which was causing a number of issues, most visible one - the sphere of influence of the target was not being drawn.
Changed Telemetry panel so that it shows 7 digits, one of which is a decimal place. This helps bridge the gap from KM to GM and beyond.
Fixed a variety of issues with gauge offsetting where incorrect parent values were being used to generate the UV positions.
Added ability to rescale UI elements in the editor, to make scaling changes much easier.
Added better support for exporting gauge UI changes into XML to ease the editing process.
Dramatically decrease the tolerance for Kepler solves. This drives physics handoff errors in high solar orbits down dramatically, but all Kepler solves in the default solar system still seem to be under 10 iterations which is totally acceptable.
Decrease max default Kepler iterations from 1000 to 50 to limit the damage from the worst-case scenario.
Decoupled Kepler tolerance from a global value which is most likely to be used for unit testing to prevent unexpected side effects.

Switched discord notify to new embed system for testing.
Added Expiry processing to FlightPlans and BurnPlans. This is because the solver only searches a certain time into the future for encounters. We need to expire them on the first encounter or at the end of the time we searched and recalculate them.
Added Expiry of transfer planner burn creation if the time passes before the user presses "Create".
Fixed the Impact and Encounter hover information Time in: readout was wrong and showing negative values. Victim of cut and paste.
Fixed SoI sphere gizmo causing burn node gizmos to not draw correctly. This required adding a second pass to the gizmo pass(es) to get the transparency working. The index of the pass the gizmo should be rendered in is now specified by the 'PassIndex' variable. The vast majority of gizmos should currently be in pass 0.
Integrated flight plan expiry into the the inner vehicle update loop.
Fixed an error where the expiry time could be the start of the flight plan if the closest encounter occurred at the start of a patch.
Fixed an error in Orbit.GetRemainingTimeTo where a negative time could be returned.
Fixed an issue where patches from last frame were being compared against patches from the current frame and giving false equality checks when trying to create a burn node.
Fixed issue where not all constructors in FlightPlan were setting the reference Id.
Fixed issue where a patch was more than one period was causing incorrect orbit points generation and subsequent rendering of the orbit points to be incorrect.
Fixed missing set flightplan expiry when an impact occurs.
Fixed the closest approach info vs an actual Encounter info in the Flightplan UI to make it easier to distinguish between closest approaches and encounters.
Make atmosphere reflection attenuation much slower for vessels. The
reflection was changing from atmosphere to stars way too fast when
exiting the atmosphere before.
Added application always on top setting, that will force the application window to always be on top while running.
Added default setting to focus the game window on launch to help prevent graphics api buffering issues when multithreaded loading overloads the OS during launch, running out of VRAM and causing crashes.
Added always on top setting to windows and gauge panels, on by default. This will force detatched windows to be rendered on top of everything, making them much easier to use.

When in non-debug builds, the shader compiler now optimizes for performance. Interesting to note, glslc seems to default to performance optimizations but libshaderc (whether normally or due to interop shenanigans) defaults to no optimizations.

Map grid now turns off when UI is toggled off.
Did another pass on distant celestial rendering to get them closer to how we render our stars.
All attitude tracking targets now reference the inertial CCI frame internally. This makes the requirement for attitude target angular rates explicit in all cases.
Split out custom attitude target into its own field which is now required since we still want those to be frame-relative.
Added missing angular rates for surface velocity and vehicle attitude targets. This should significantly improve tracking performance in these cases.
Added new Flight Path (FLP), Docking (DOCK), and Target Velocity (TVEL) frames internally to support the new attitude targets.
Switched 'toward' and 'away' targets to reference the local up vector instead of the target's up vector.
Rearranged TGT panel attitude target buttons to more closely follow the convention of the main panel.
Relabeled the VLF frame on the control panels from VEL to OVEL to try and emphasize that it's orbital velocity.
Reworded NUL ROT tooltip to clarify that RCS is incapable of perefectly nulling all rotation.

Internally renamed VehicleReferenceFrame.Tgt to VehicleReferenceFrame.Dock. The XML enum value is still Tgt until I figure out how to prevent it from throwing an exception when loading old saves.
Deleted old Vehicle.DrawAttitudeControlPanel() method since it's now unused.
Fix TAIL coordinate frame rotation rates.
Fixed the TGT-relative NUL ROT button which got missed in my enum change.
Refined rendering of distant celestial objects and their blending from sprites to spheres. Blending now occurs both on the sprite and the emission of the distant sphere, both occurring prior to rendering very close with spherical billboards.
Added celestial sprite occlusion. Child moons will occlude their sprites at all distances, when their parent is occluding them from the sun. This is tied with the skybox shadow option, so can be disabled.
Added size based blending of celestial sprites. This ensures that child objects merge with their parent at great distances, such as child planets merging correctly with their parent when viewing a star from a another solar system.
Added handling of stellar sprites. The primary body (sun) is now handled like regular a celestial object, allowing rendering of distant stellar systems to be handled by the celestial sprite system. This is blended with the lens flare system.

Version 2025.9.5.2298
Fixed handling of different events (Impact, multiple Encounters, Escape) in patched conics to correctly identify which event comes first and process accordingly. - Second attempt. This time handles closest approaches correctly and after first escape. This fixes the fact that before patched conics logic was not handling impacts, encounters and escapes in the correct time sequence, which it was not necessarily doing correctly before.
Refactored Input handling, to split the functionality into match and contains. Previously, we were using a single pattern to assess an input action as contains (except for a few hardcoded differences). Now two patterns are available. Existing functionality is split between contains which will allow returning true if that series of keys are active, even if others are (i.e. thrusters), versus if the required series only are (i.e. a toggle).
Fixed Stabilization toggle would work inconsistently with input actions, as it was handled via a contains pattern, not a match pattern.
Refactored Input code to use a common struct, rather than an exploded collection of arguments, as this was getting tiresome passing through the action chain. This additional meant that necessary context was often lost, such as which window the input was being provided in.
Fixed some controls would not work in new windows, as the input context was lost as it was not being passed through. OnKey now requires a common struct, so context is always passed through.
Fixed control assignments would not be correctly captured. There still exists a bug where they are not being correctly read in, breaking control assignments from load.
Fixed targeting a celestial object that is not a vehicle such as a planet or moon, will generate a null reference exception. Now you can use the targeting control panel with celestial bodies.
Changed VehicleUpdateTask to use both a stackalloc and a rented array for Thruster states, to remove allocation occuring per frame. This was a minimal allocation in current testing, but with large numbers of vehicles in the hundreds, or thousands, it would generate significant memory garbage.

The flight computer now correctly tracks objects in Keplerian orbits, even at high time warp.
Added methods to retrieve object Keplerian velocity at a given game time.
Fixed a method name spelling error.
Fix for secondary viewports when moving between windows with different DPI scaling
Fixed keybindings would not be loaded. This occurred due to changes in TOML serialization. Now saved keybindings will be correctly loaded when set by the user.
Added keybindings are only serialized if they are different from the default, to ease changes to default keybindings during development. If the user sets a custom binding, it will not be touched - but if the user is using the default binding, it will be updated if the default changes. Credit: Anth.
Overhauled KSA lighting to utilize clustered lighting which greatly improves performance and increases how many active lights we can have at one time. (was 32 max now with current tests at 1000+)
LightCollection to hold the CPU specific light info.
LightUtils for functions that help with light calculations.
FramePackedVkBuffer to aid in packing lots of data into one buffer and making it easier to work with frames in flight
Tetrahedral based shadow calcs for point lights, reducing how many times the closest objects are required to be re-rendered and thus improving performance in comparison to the traditional cube maps
Shadow atlas to pack shadow maps into one texture.
WIP Spotlight shadows (just need to sort out the sampling part)
A debug window for lights (holds CPU times, debug visuals and more info on the way)
Inverse VP  now can be accessed from camera
Added light intensity value
VmaAllocator now in program and can be passed into classes such as FramePackedBuffers
Changed the light z-sorting to use a Radix sort instead of purely a less than comparison, improving performance.
Moved BufferHelpers to Extensions folder.
Enabled the light PBR calculations to get better visuals.
Changed cluster selection in shaders from brute force to O(1)
Renamed LightData.glsl to PunctualLighting.glsl for clarity
Changed attenuation calcs to vulkan gltf extension recommendation in preparation to make it easier for designers  to curate lights
Removed light type from flags and promoted to it's own var
Removed DescriptorPool from ShadowMapSystem in favor of a passed in one
Refactored part of Orbit's GetNearestPoint() logic since it was taking up a significant portion of frame time. Still using the old system for hyperbolic orbits as they need a bit more precision.
Fixed some GetNearestPoint() logic that was unintentionally behind a null check.
Fixed light transmitance color being black due to dark side of the planet results in early escape from mesh rendering, causing lights to not be drawn (or their shadows) when a vessel is in the shadow of the planet.
Added a simple color darkening for distant celestial sprites depending on the approximate lit fraction of the visible disc. This mostly works seamlessly but does show a little bit of artifacting in the sprite-sphere blend phase.
Added the first ability to set a spacecraft roll target independently from a pointing target. Currently you can set NORM (behaves as previously), INVERT (rolls 180 degrees from NORM), or ANY (nulls out roll rate but does not try to control roll angle).
Added First pass on Location music player. Plays music tracks tagged with the current SOI parent ID.
Added tweaks to distant object rendering. Now blending is much better between sprites and their distant spheres. The minimums have been reduced a bit, and the sun is now better modulated based on its distance, ready to render multiple solar systems at once.

Version 2025.9.8.2336
Fix culling thread group count on one dimension exceeding the min guaranteed by Vulkan spec
Clamp distant celestial sprite shadowing factor - previously it was possible for it to become greater than one.
Implemented blackrack's edge tessellation heuristic into the terrain tessellation eval shader.
Moved edge tessellation heuristic from OceanTessControl.tesc to TessellationFuncs.glsl.
Separated Biplanar texture sampling function into a version with a standard texture sample and one with a textureGrad sample.
Expanded manual control lockout system to be more fine-grained and issue precisely-worded alerts in all cases where manual inputs are disregarded.
Manual engine ignition is explicitly turned off in auto-burn mode to prevent a leftover manual ignition from overriding auto-burn engine shutdown.
Removed scaling and offset of point lights for thrusters to fix issues with sim speeds below 1x
Fixed a bug where distant celestial rendering was setting bad depth values causing all downstream rendering to be culled.
Added Sample accurate music scheduling for SOI music system. When SyncPoints are specified in a music file the LocationMusicPlayer will switch tracks at the next available sync point. If none are added the music will switch directly.
Updated the assignment of shadow tiles to lights, as some lights were rendering depth when they should not be.
Added nuget package MathNet.Numerics to use for Eigen value calcuations.
Added ConjunctionAssessment class containing new closest approach method to solve: Conjunction Assessment Thnrough Chebyshev Polynomials (CATCH).
This is the new core math for solving closest approaches and encounters. On the surface the player will not notice much diference after this change, but it is more efficient and accurate than the old solver.
It sets us up to make further improvements and changes in the closest approach calculations and visuals.
Added Id string to PatchedConics and related data so that we have a backwards lookup to what Astronomical the Patch is for. Before this we only had the Parent body reference for the Patch Orbit.
Changed porkchop worker to split it's work further into four more worker tasks.
Renamed ClosestPoints struct to Encounter.
Changed PatchedConic.TryFindEncounter to TryFindEncounters and returns an array of all encounters with the body asked for. As there may be more than one.
Changed CheckUpdateEncounter replacing the old closest approach solver/logic with new CATCH logic.
Removed redundant old closest approach solver code.
Fixed issue in setting closest distance info on porkchop plots to ensure we are setting it for the target astronomical.
Fixed encounters are now possible with non-orbiting objects. EG: Sol aka The Sun aka a Star.
Corrected main engine plume and audio to match the actual engine thrust rather than the manual throttle setting. This was incorrect in the case where the manual input was set differently to the auto-burn control.
Renamed Vehicle.GetThrottle() to Vehicle.GetManualThrottle() to avoid future confusion.
Renamed two ThrusterState fields and added brief docs to clarify their meanings.
Set navball frame when toggling on/off auto burn mode.
The burn computer will no longer ignite the main engine until the thrust direction is nearly aligned with the burn direction. This avoids burning in the wrong direction if auto burn is activated too late.
Modify closest approach search to clamp to half of the primary orbit.
Raise default search polynomial order to 16.
Fixed There could be an occasional burst of wind noise when transitioning in and out of atmospheric flight.

Version 2025.9.9.2364
Fix for planet shadowing when the camera is at a negative altitudes.
Preparation for soft shadows.
Added a constructor for spotlights for sanitizing values.
Added first pass on a spot light part. Still need to handle emissives and conditional rendering during the depth pass.
Animate ocean waves using FFT, extract normals and sideways
displacement from FFT data
Perform FFT in compute shader groupshared memory using Stockham's

Use multiple FFT cascades at different scales to minimize tiling and
performance cost
Allow large gerstner and FFT waves to be combined. Not polished, just for
a showcase/example of how to combined different wave data
Fix remaining ocean surface jittering
Add specialization constants info to ComputePipelineWrapper
Optimize atmosphere reflections to only sample LUTS when intersecting
the atomsphere. This was a quick optimization that didn't take much
effort.
Converted light system to dynamic instancing, making it easier to create lights on the fly.
Proof of concept RCS light animation based on VolumetricExhaust Emissive Curve
Re-added missing mesh file declaration for the apollo burn thruster mesh.
Added very basic emissive map support for our PBR mesh rendering. Currently just applied to the 'no push constants' shader version as we're switching over to the instanced rendering only anyways.
Show the actual closest approach with the targeted object. Previously we were only showing the first approach.
Optimized the light clusters by reducing the clipping planes. Lights past a certain depth are basically not visible so we might as well avoid calculations in the void.
Added a light system gpu settings for controlling cluster counts, bias, and clipping planes from cpu.
Fixed inter-planetary Transfer Planner calculations so they are now closer to where they should be. Need some more work to actually iterate on them to hit the target SOI. But we are now going in the correct direction.
Fixed wrong squash merge conflict resolution for OrbitalTransfers class.
Fixed manual Burn created on parent orbit move to vehicle orbit.
Small fix for when lights instances are cleared. It was causing the debug window to show incorrect data.
Renamed Cluster to LightCluster to be more descriptive
Fixed a second case where we were only showing the first encounter rather than the closest.
Added code to filter out "closest approaches" with very large range rates. These are not actual closest approaches, just minimum distances within the allowed time bounds.
Adjusted wording and verbosity on patched conic start/end UI markers to improve clarity.
Improved range rate encounter filter for small closest approach values.
Fixed another case of incomplete encounter searching.
Added gemini6a as a nearby target for gemini7.
Display physics debug overlay info for all vehicles in the nearby vicinity, not just the current vehicle.
Fix problem with version detection
Added ability to use Transfer Planner to create transfers to other planets whilst in Solar orbit.
Added separation of Closest Approaches from actual Encounters.
Changed patched conics processing to only capture actual encounter information when calculating new flight plans and burn plans.
Changed Vehicle Set Target processing to now capture closest approach data only to the set target.
Removed override closest approach checkbox and associated code from Transfer Planner as it is no longer relevant.
Changed Encounter and Closest approach processing to ensure we only search and show encounters or approaches between the patch start and end times.
Changed the number of Polynomials to use in CATCH for closest approach processing in the transfer planner. This saves a lot of time and the closest approach value isn't as critical in the transfer planner, it is not used to determine the actual encounters.
Fixed orbit line drawing culling on hyperbolic trajectories on the parent or grandparent celestial too early. This was causing potential hyperbolic eject trajectories subsequent to escape from a moon to not being drawn until the camera was quite far away.
Fixed to ensure that flight plan expiry is also set based on closest approach windows searched for target as well. This has changed due to changes to split encounters from closest approaches earlier today.
Split out per-vehicle data from the overall update loop in VehicleUpdateTask. This is the first step towards solving multiple vehicles in the same loop.
Removed vehicle update flags since they are no longer needed.
Restored closest approach range rate filter.

Fixed bug in ImGuiHelper.BeginColumns - one overload not calculating column widths correctly.
Added ValueIn(time unit) to SimTime struct to return the time in the passed in time unit.
Added Minutes, Hours, Weeks, Months, Years properties to SimTime struct to return the value in each unit.
Added ToNearest( time unit) to TimeSpanReference to return formatted time in the requested time unit for display to UI.
Added dropdown to set time unit to Transfer Planner UI. All Times shown in the Transfer Planner will be displayed in the selected time unit.
Added output of Hohmann transfer time and minimum/maximum transfer time sliders. Allows the player to now set the minimum and maximum time of flight (between the source and destination) before asking for a porkchop plot.The Transfer planner will now create porkchops for the selected minimum and maximum transfer time range set by the player.

Fixed CPU-side curve LUT evaluation not linearly interpolating between values.
Fixed garbage allocations coming from normal map decoding.
Fix Vulkan errors when using atmosphere luts for reflections. The errors were fixed by transitioning the luts before and after using them.
Rename "planetShaders" to "shaders" in Vehicle.cs
Changed Find Closest approach / encounter code to first do a geometry test to set the start and end range closer to the expected time of encounter. This has sped this part of the process up two-fold.
LightSystem buffer byte sizes now visible in debug window.
Added FormatBytes to ByteEx to return a string suffixing the short form e.g. B, KB, MB, etc.

Fixed ability to add burn to parent body orbit line and then transfer it to the controlled vehicle flight plan. This was removed when the gizmo was updated a few months back.
Added missing override for GetStateVectorsAt( game time) to Vehicle class.
Fixed so we don't actually need an actual encounter with our target body to transfer a burn from the parent orbit to the vehicle's flight plan.
Show distance and time of flight on closest approach markers.

Add checkbox option for vessel reflections. Reflections are cheap now, but may become expensive later on with more meshes.
Fix vessel reflections showing when the stars or atmosphere was turned off.
Add shader specialization constant support to RenderTechnique.cs. I
had this code handy from trying to use specialization constants for the
reflection settings, so I decided to paste it in here for when we need
it later.
Corrected Titan physical atmosphere characteristics from HASI data.
Fixed maffs for FindClosestPoints - which was actually just an initial guess, and actually was literally the line of nodes. So renamed it to FindLineOfNodes and simplified it.
Fixed some of the logic when looking for closest approaches to use two initial guesses a bit more methodically and ensure we are clamping to the patch start and end times. Also consolidate to one search if the two initial guesses are within one orbital period (tMax value).
Fixed UI display of double.MaxValue in EndTime of patches in the flight Plan UI and instead replaced with (Infinity) text in this case.
Changed UI display to show multiple closest approaches if they are within 2 x minimum distance range.
Added a timeout and timeout handling on porkchop worker tasks.
Added MathEx.ToOrbitAngle TrueAnomaly overload to change angle and return a TrueAnomaly.
Added int PatchedConics.ClosestApproachesTo(id) to return number of closest approaches to another object by id.
Fixed creating burn on parent orbit not changing the parent orbit line colour. Fixed this by cloining the parent orbit for our burn patch rather than using the parent's orbit itself. PRobably better if we do this anyway, because we don't want to accidentally change the parent's orbit. Although, that could lead to some fun exploits.
Initial pass on part trees. Parts can now be modified by grouped branches of the tree.
Fixed missing push constants when renderering instanced meshes.
Burn node dragging no longer culls drag points if the mouse gets too far from the orbit. This should make dragging feel much smoother.
Fixed issue where we end up on a straight orbit with low energy being incorrectly defined as hyperbolic. This was causing NaNs for calculation of state vectors. This case was found by Raiz around Titan where currently Titan does not rotate.
Fixed incorrect formula for the hyperbolic semi-latus rectum.
Fixed a case where the new eccentricity formulation could become NaN.
Fixed hovering over apoapsis and periapsis markers not working in some situations.
Periapsis and apoapsis markers are now shown for all patches for the controlled vehicle's trajectory and planned trajectory.

Next task is to split 'core' into submods to allow easier total conversion mods and better data separation down the line.
Added gradient evaluation to CubicHermiteSpline.
Changed terrain modifier LUT from R16 storing value to R16G16 storing value and gradient.
Added gradient voronoi noise function.

Added 'Gradient' map type to the planet map exporter.
GetHeightMetersAt() in HeightFuncs.glsl now returns the gradient as well as the height value.
Fixed derivative/gradient miscalculation in the Simplex Noise library where subsequent octave gradients were not being rescaled by the new frequency.
Changed procedural modifier LUT format from R16G16Unorm to R16G16SFloat to allow negative values for cubic hermite spline derivatives.
Added Eroded Craters modifier.
Added shader logic and CPU logic for the new eroded craters modifier.
Fixed errors in the simplex noise library where the gradient was incorrectly scaled.
Improved gradient calculation in the erosion function. Not yet sure if this is correct but it's a decent approximation.
Corrected modifier gradients by scaling by the celestial radius reciprocal. Not all modifiers return correct gradients yet but this scaling was missing.
Added a gradient visualisation to the planet exporter which computes the surface normal from the planet gradient rather than by using central differences. This will be useful for validating whether modifier gradients are correct.
Adjusted existing Erosion modifiers on Earth and Mars to respect the changes to the Erosion function.
Fixed calculation of Argument of Periapsis when creating orbits where our Ascending Node is in the plane. In this case we must use the two dimension equation.

Deleted teleport states from the vehicle update task. We now directly modify the orbit in the UI context when the workers are shut down and this is safe to do.
Fixed issue where Transfer Planner was picking up mouse clicks even when the mouse was outside it's window. This caused the selected point to be changed and be drawn outside of the transfer planner window.
Fixed issue with porkchop best and select points markers being drawn above other overlapping UI windows.
Added buttons to Transfer Planner under the Porkchop plot that allows the user to fine tune the selected porkchop point up/down/left/right one index at a time.
Fixed further improvements to the transfer planner to adjust our Lambert solutions for our porkchop to ensure we get an encounter (sometimes it misses, due to imprecisions in the methods we are using to convert the hyperboic escape velocity back to the starting orbit, and that assumes near circular orbit). This is a placeholder brute force adjustement. A further iteration is needed to replace this method with a gradient descent method to allow us to solve the encounter in a more methodical method that will also allow us to solve the encounter end to create a solution to a user defined ending altitude/radius.
New combined sun shadow system in preparation for vessels casting shadows onto terrain.

Converted all usages of the old sun shadow systems to now utilize the new system.
Removed old sun shadow renderers.
Fixed discontinuities in erosion modifier value and gradients.
Added new bool flag to the astronomical body template "TidallyLocked" which is false by default. For bodies that have this defined as true they will not have their rotation period automatically calculated and set at startup to match their orbital period so that they are tidally locked.
Fixed issue where satellites (moons) in the solar system were not correctly tidally locked in their rotation period.
Reapply "* Fixed calculation of burn duration and ignition time for burn UI to incorporate user set throttle setting."
Throttle setting is only considered when the FlightComputer is in Manual mode. In Automatic Mode throttle is currently set at 100% for the UI calculations and the burn regardless of what the user has set it too.
Moved the shader layouts for shadows out of the common glsl and added them to each frag/comp shader that used them, allowing for better control over.
Changed the shadows glsl calculations to require parameters for a shadow struct uniform and texture.
Removed unneeded lighting/shadows includes from vert shaders.

Added right clicking on parts to show info on it.
Changed how the map gains control of the keyboard for offsetting the camera by adding an 'active' boolean rather than solely relying on a nullable check to make it less confusing to find the current vehicle. This fixes a few inconsistencies with orbit markers not being drawn when they should. As a byproduct, this enables the vehicle UI in map mode whether or not you are actively controlling the vehicle you are following. I'm not 100% sure which way I like more so I'll leave it for now and see how people feel.
Removed map mode from the camera mode shift hotkey.
Added message for swapping to orbit camera from free camera so players get consistent feedback.
Fixed SoI's being drawn when they are targets of vehicles that are not currently followed. SoIs will still be drawn if the 'ShowSphereOfInfluence' flag is set if we want to display SoIs of other vehicle targets but showing all targets seems like an oversight.
Fixed the map recenter logic immediately focusing on the controlled vehicle rather than recentering to the currently focused astronomical first.

Moved modifier functions to new ModifiersCommon.glsl.
Added first set of RCS Thruster parts.
Updated SubPart creation to respect a template's custom transforms.
Added ability in code to mark a Burn instance as no longer valid. And the worker process - when applying changes will delete invalid Burns. This allows and enforces changes to persistent data to occur at the correct time.
Fixed and enhanced the "Parent Eject Burn" functionality. This includes projecting and displaying the full flightplan from parking orbit when creating and manipulating a parent eject burn.
The Burn UI now provides better UX and feedback on what the DV is from the Parent Orbit (where the burn is located) and the actual DV and time that the burn will require to meet the burn from the parking orbit.
Initial implementation of Thin Film Interference. Currently implemented on all rockets, will be updated to be masked when assets are ready. Thin Film Interference is an optical effect which results in a rainbow-like colorshift around surfaces such as heated metal and glass.
Renamed ReflectionPushConstants to PBRPushConstants due to including non-reflection values.
Fixed calculation of max time value used for Conjunction Assessment when Finding Closest Approach when both orbits we are testing are unbound. This was a TODO, prior to this if both orbits are unbound no closest approach assessment was being made.
Fixed broken burn input fields in UI that I broke when making "Parent Eject Burn" changes yesterday.
Updated NormalMap calculations to fix an error with how tangents are interpolated, currently only applied to vessel shader.
Added SharedFrag shader file, for common shader code that can only compile in the fragment shader, such as dFdx/dFdy.
Delete old Gemini textures. The textures have been fixed, so the old

Properly handle part transforms in thruster definitions.
Moved unused source files to source folder so they were not taking up space in the build, roughly 1GB of files.
Added passage hatch part.
Fixed an issue where we were missing an orbit point from our orbit line rendering for patches with start and end TA not default.
Settings resolution maximums now apply to DDS files and 16-bit channel PNG/JPGs. KTX is still unresized for the time being.
Rationalized two GenerateSpacedPoints methods (one for bound and one for unbound) into one method.
Moved engine definitions from vehicles to parts.
Merged thrusters and engines for most runtime purposes.
Renamed thruster to rocket in several instances where the object could either be a thruster or an engine.
Resized all terrain textures to more appropriate resolutions.
Improved Earth's cliff texture blending.
Removed unused Mars diffuse and normal maps.
Optimized the default mesh collection. Number of triangles reduced from ~5 million to ~1.6 million. The new mesh collection halves in resolution every log2 meters from the surface which means each LOD should be the same size on the screen, eliminating subpixel triangles that were previously harming performance from orbit.
Some adjustments to the game time and sim speed UI to make it more consistent.
Some more tweaks to the game time UI layout. Dean can fix it if he still doesn't like it.
Adjusted the timeout on the transfer planner worker tasks to allow a bit longer especially when it's calculating transfers to the outer planets on slower machines.
Added first set of fuel tank parts.
Fixed the font scale in the game time UI.
Added medium service module part.
Added a quick and dirty routine to remap thruster key bindings based on part position and orientation.
Regenerate flight computer vehicle config data when a vehicle is edited.
Recompute bounding sphere radius when a vehicle is edited.

Version 2025.10.8.2502
Split VolumetricExhaustReference data from Instance data into VolumetricExhaustInstance. Now we do not need to clone all data for each volumetric exhaust. Instead we create an instance for each with a reference to the single reference data required.
Fixed bug where deserializing a save with burns that have a parent of a non-IOrbiting astronomical (ie. The Sun) will throw an exception and fail to deserialize.
Fixed so we only show closest approaches within 1.5x the closest opverall approach distance to reduce the number of approaches displayed in the UI.
Fixed measuring of distance from vehicle to instead use distance to camera to display the celestial boxes and names in the UI.
Improve ocean shading, generate physically accurate roughness values based on the Atlas presentation and the paper "Linear Efficient Antialiased Displacement and Reflectance Mapping"

Mesh abstraction changes that allow for buffer packing
Removed unused renderers
Fixed Orbit line colours in additional camera windows not using the colours as per what is being followed. ie: followed vehicle orbit lines where being drawin the in inactive colour instead of the active colour in camera windows other than the main window.
Fixed UI display of orbiting objects names and details so that it now also displays in additional camera windows, not just the main window.
Fix broken RCS exhaust transient startup and shutdown animations

Added Destroy console command to destroy and remove a vehicle from the simulation.
Fixed cursor pos update when hovering on any window, not just main window.
Fixed hovering UI details update when hovering over an astronomical in any camera window, not just main window.
Fixed some of the logic around deciding whether to drawn ORbital Lines and markers when not following a vehicle and checking if the viewport we are drawing in is in Mapnode (not just the main viewport).
Fixed small tweak to last commit to ensure we aren't always drawing orbit lines and markers for the followed vehicle and still obey the distance from camera and camera mode rules.
Added ability to circularise elliptical orbits at Apoapsis or Periapsis to the Transfer Planner.
Fixed CubeMesh generation code, which was causing artifacts for high subdivision counts.
Fixed distant sphere renderer not sampling the planet's normal map.
Fixed planet mesh collection always trying to use the Default mesh in the mesh data pass, which would cause the planet to disappear if trying to render with a different mesh.
Added Phobos.
Added mesh collection "AsteroidScaleMesh" for very small celestial bodies.
Added variable terrain detail fade start and fade end values, useful when configuring tiny celestial bodies.

Rename OptimizedMeshes to OceanMeshes
Bandaid fix to stop the camera shifting while moving parts in the editor.
Added medium capsule part.
Fixed no longer deleting burns that are in the future from another burn when the earlier burn is changed. Future burns will still be deleted if an earlier burn is deleted. But now they will be adjusted if the earlier burn is only moved or changed.
Replaced one of the default geminis with new version using new parts. Thrusters need some work still. The new parts may need a big rotation to match coordinate spaces properly.
Fixed Earth terrain material displacements that were too high.
Adjusted the detail fade altitudes for Earth to improve the transition from orbit to surface with the new mesh collection.
Updates to Brutal.Core 0.3.1. Multiple texture changes.

Version 2025.10.11.2540
Fixed issue with modifying burns causing subsequent burns to be drawn in the wrong locations.
Rationalized data in Burn class. Removed references to OrbitPointCce and PatchedConic. These can be determined when required instead of storing references.
Fixed backwards matrix multiplication causing subpart->part->vehicle transforms to be out of order. This fixes the new part thrusters not lining up correctly visually. Fixes for the automapping being incorrect coming with proper model rotations SoonTM.
Add optional feature to color match clouds to terrain, use on Mars to match dust storms locally to the ground color
Add a per-planet max cloud shadows altitude setting
Fix seams on cloud shadow main texture derivatives, most visible on Mars, use the same methods as Planet.frag
Tweak dust storm settings
Sample mips in 2d clouds shader
Soft-fade cloud shadows when terrain approaches cloud top
Fixed incorrect visible area calculation for the Default mesh collection.
Changed the fly camera minimum terrain height to 2 meters now that we can better visually represent this scale.
Fixed windowed screen size being offset by the OS window decorations.
Fixed a small spelling mistake in the description of the 'invert' button on the RCS UI.
Added support for gltf parent node transforms for meshes. It shouldn't change anything right now but may make rotating things easier later. If your mesh is rotated all weird all of a sudden this is why but I think I got them all.
Fixed orientation of new gemini parts. The autokeymapping should be oriented correctly. This does not change the current requirement to toggle the editor for the autokeymap to take effect. Should be my next change.
Changed calculation of mesh vertex position mins and maxs to use gltf's rather than be recalculated.
Changed auto keymapping for RCS to effect both in editor as well as when there is no control manually set.
Added preparation code for thumbnail editor

Defaulted the distant sphere metallic and roughness values to those in planet.frag.
Rationalized some more data in Burn Flightplans. Removed unnecessary need for first patch to be copied into each burn's flightplan.
Fixed deleting of future burns when you delete an earlier burn. Now that we have decoupled all the data, you can happily delete burns in any order and all existing burns will simply stay on the Time that they were created and move to your current flightplan.

First cut of putting vehicles on rails when splashed down on dynamic waves. This works well in most situations but breaks if you swap to a vehicle in orbit of the same celestial because the wave height sampler returns erratic answers - need to solve this case.

Added the first main fuel tank part and engine part.
Added both new parts to the default gemini.
Changed the normals used for lighting in the mesh shader

Fixed patch colour for burn patches not being set to the parent patch colour shade.
Fixed patch colour darkening for each subsequent patch.
Increased the amplitude of Earth's sand dunes.
Updated the Brutal.Vulkan package to version 0.1.1, this is a huge refactor that affects almost everything Vulkan related in the project.
Add shader hot reloader. The reloader can be turned on in the settings menu under "Graphics -> Debug -> Shader hot reloading". The code is integrated into the ModLibrary shader loading code. When a shader file is changed in the project directory, the file is copied into the runtime directory. Currently, only the shader files in the project directory are supported, not the files in the runtime directory (this will be fixed soon). Include files are also handled by reloading all dependencies.
Add shader compiler include resolve callbacks.
Add file watcher.
Add filepath and Content path utility code.
Fix ModLibrary using Windows only path separators.
Changed default controled vehicle to the New Gemini craft, the one that utilizes our first parts. Includes a helper function to figure out the orbit camera settings.
Bindless texture support added
Deleting unused rendering code
Delete ShaderPaths.cs. We have been using the ModLibrary to load shaders instead, so this file is redundant.

Version 2025.10.6.2584
Added first pass XML representation for part trees/hierarchies.
Optimized MergeEncounters to use stackalloc and rented array for provided encounters, this can run a lot when engine is firing or physics is conducted. This will matter much more later, when many vessels exist and for interactions with large numbers of potential encounters such as around jupiter-like planets.
Optimized MergeEncounters second pass, changed the initial EncounterInfo from a list to a rented array. This means that there is now no list allocations when assessing encounters with celestial bodies.
Optimized id Comparison in flightplan. Now instead of using the string, the hash is used. This will be much faster at scale. A more generic solution will be implemented later. This commit should be reverted if it causes issues.
Fixed display of orbit lines and UI markers to respect the show orbit flag and if the astronomical is set to the target of the currently controlled vehicle it will always show regardless of the show orbit flag.
Added support for thin film interference masks. This allows us to create thin film maps for specific parts, or disable it if no map is provided.
Removed PbrMeshRenderTechnique, this is a legacy system and should not be used anymore.
Previously Mesh.frag/vert were legacy shaders, and MeshNoPush.frag/vert were the main shaders used for vessels. MeshNoPush.frag/vert has now been renamed to Mesh.frag/vert and the original Mesh.frag/vert shaders have been deleted.
Consolidated MeshFragCommon.glsl into Mesh.frag.
Fixed applying the "Darkening" to the subsequent patch orbit colours twice. We should only do it once. Cause that was making things really hard to see.
Fixed simulation metrics were being reset each frame, breaking debugging completely. This may cause serious issues when simulation degrades. This will be fixed when brutal is updated to provide LastTickTime and a function to get the max value.
Turned off initialization of the asset reloader when disabled as it was crashing production builds. The builds should no longer crash.
Added a final message when loading to avoid false positive reports of errors that happen after the last loading message and before the first frame.

Change shader hot reloading checkbox text to warn against using it on a build version of the game. This text will be removed once the bug is fixed later.
Fixed display of Ap and Pe markers on Burn patches.
Smoothed out the scaling of the sun shadow volume for planets
Visual improvements on PCF, the range was too large.
Trialing an adaptive filter count on PCSS (may help with GPU performance but needs more testing)
Fix issue with dust storms drawing over craft in certain orbits
Added current gravitation to the celestial info window.
Moved temporary metrics reset point to after we collect job metrics. This was preventing simulation speed descaling from functioning.
Disable shader hot reloader for production builds. This is a temporary fix for the shader reloader crash, and a proper fix will be implemented soon.
Fixed Burn edit UI not appearing once you have completed the Burn or it was in the past and no longer on the flightplan.
Fixed opacity and fading on orbit patches to be more obvious and to include Burn - Burn patches.
Optimized use of string looking for id when doing encounters, standardized to use of IOrbiting as the implication is clearer and cleaner, and then used Hash for comparison instead of string.
Fixed flight plan exceptions were being written to dev console, not to game console.
Fixed so you can no longer create a Burn on an invalid timeline part of a patch/flightplan. EG: Clicking on the original patch after another Burn.
Optimized FindClosestApproaches first pass, moved timeRanges to use stackalloc and avoid unnecessary allocation. Much more to follow.
Swapped the 'positive' direction burn node mesh from a cone to a cone with a little tail. The reverse is still just a cone.
Increased color contrast between 'positive' and 'negative' burn node handles.
Optimized Chebyshev Polynomial Catch Conjunction Assessment to utilize stackalloc instead of Lists. This is heavily utilized for encounters, so runs a lot on the simulation. This change will dramatically reduce both the allocation cost and execution cost of the function, by utilizing buffers. Still returning a List, will be switched to a rented array.
Slightly decreased the contrast between 'positive' and 'negative' burn node handles. We had a non-colorblind person come look at it.
Added delete button to part menus (accessible by right clicking on the part) in debug vehicle editor.
Optimized Catch Candidates to be returned as a rented array, avoiding allocation costs when evaluating encounters. Next step will be to migrate last phase of Encounters to be a rented array, rather than lists. Dynamic Celestial objects evaluate this both when changing their orbits, but also as they progress through. So this optimization will benefit significantly, especially with lots of dynamic objects.
Fixed thin film interference appearing brighter on darker materials, due to how it was getting mixed into the diffuse.
Added texture size setting LightSystem shadow atlas.
Reduced down the LightSystem shadow slots to 16 (drastically improves performance )
Centered the vehicle's camera when leaving the editor and loading.
Job metric changes (#72)
Reduce garbage in metrics collection
Fixed job timing for rare case
Updated to framework 25.10.0.5
Added cached metric function
Improved light priorities based on screen influence, distance and intensity
Added a hard cap to light count (512 for now)
Optimized IJK matrix generation. Implemented static caching of precomputed IJK coefficients keyed by N. The matrix is built only on first request and reused on subsequent calls, eliminating repeated cosine and scaling computations. Benchmark test case runtime improved from approximately 9 ms to 2.5 ms after this change (with other optimizations applied).

Compressed diffuse/PBR/thin film texture maps to DDS BC1.
Increased thin film interference intensity, to make the effect more visible when using custom masks.

Re-added required include for production builds.
Cat works with multisampling and window resizes
Added ability to add or remove the helmet for the kitten. This is currently hard coded to on, however the logic for toggling it is ready to be hooked into where needed.
Added initial expressions setup. Similar to above this isn't currently tied into any systems, so the kitten is defaulted to being scared.
Added LOD system for cat fur, aswell as quality settings to adjust the maximum number of fur shells rendered per cat.
Fixed crash on launch caused by the fur renderer sometimes being null, when initializing dependent systems.
Kitten animation speed is now affected by global simulation speed. This currently does not affect the viewing direction of the cats.
Fixed crash caused by trying to dispose the fur renderer when its null.
Cleanup of fur resources, setting up glass shader
Turned off libshaderc optimizations due to causing infinite hanging when creating some compute pipelines on 6000 series AMD cards.

De-duplicate functions in tesselation and screen-space ocean shaders
Fix typo in exhaust startOffset
Fixed MSAA issue with fur renderer (at least on startup)
Transparency works with bucket system
Restored fur
Fixed broken parent eject burn creation. This was broken due to changes made to the flightplan and burnplan data structures a couple of weeks ago. Now brought this functionality into line with those changes so it functions again.
Added an .editorconfig to control project-specific IDE settings.
Turned off the persistent IDE recommendations to use primary constructors, as these create inconsistencies and often duplicate members unless they are used exactly correctly. Normal constructors work fine and are what people expect.
Added translucent visor to the cats helmet, textures are currently not setup for it so it looks very flat.
Fixed Transfer Planner not showing options for transfers between Moons around the same parent body.
Fixed CPU erosion terrain modifier returning slightly different values to the GPU version.
Changed the DecodeBC1, 5 and uncompressed functions to no longer return the scaled and reconstructed z normal. This means we can do bilinear interpolation before reconstructing the z component which matches the shader code. These were only used on Celestial and should be moved to a more appropriate place.
Replaced the Moon's rocky textures with dusty textures which better represents the regolith.
Added subtle erosion with low curvature to the Moon which represents surface material slumping.
Adjusted the proecdural craters on the Moon so they blend in better with the real craters.
Updated the Moon's normal map with the above change.
Reduced unnecessary work done by the complex craters modifier.
Fur renderer optimizations. Changed how the total number of fur shells directly affect the alpha threshold, meaning that less fur shells are now more viable as they appear to be 'thicker'.
Fixed Glass Renderer artifacts caused by lack of rasterization culling. This resulted in single meshes having transparency ordering artifacts.
Enabled DepthWrite for glass renderer. This fixes artifacts that were occuring when looking through glass towards earth, were there were depth sorting artifacts from water and clouds.
Very rough pass on the glass fragment shader. This has some temporary values hardcoded into it, while we wait for the visor to get proper textures made.
ImGui overhaul + Custom backend implementation for GLFW and Vulkan
Quick patch to fix an error where loading games would not restore any vehicle properties.
Fixed crash when entering debug vehicle editor. ImGui descriptor pool was running out due to thumbnails asking for a new descriptor set per frame.
Significant rework of the total physics loop as a step towards multi-vehicle physics. This clusters nearby vehicles into a single physics solver and then synchronizes their timesteps with each other. Since all vehicles in the same cluster will now share a common time grid, we can apply inter-vehicle interactions as a next step.
Added support for subparts with no meshes.
Set vehicle default bounding box and bounding sphere to non-zero values if a vehicle has no parts or parts with no meshes.
Gave kittens some propellant for their EVA activities.
Updated thumbnail rendering (no longer needs Rocket, and should be safe on window resize)

Added animations for the cat with MMU. Currently only directional loops (up, down, left, right, forward, backward).
Reduced biome map exporter memory usage by 4x, allowing us to export 16k ID and Control maps.
Cat anchoring WIP
Removed dependency to VMA
Removed unused uint functions in the biome map exporter shaders.
Minor warning/suggestion fixes and renamed Thruster.cs to Rocket.cs.
Moved cat content to different directory
Added new versions of 3 wide fuel tanks and updated fuel tank textures and meshes.
Cat is locked to MMU, and can now be treated like a vehicle when in EVA
Changed TWR gauge to display surface thrust-to-weight ratio for the currently-orbited body rather than the thrust-to-weight at your current altitude.
Fixed incorrect normals being calculated for skinned meshes. This was caused by the normals getting transformed by the inverse of the skinning matrix, instead of by the skinning matrix directly.
Made it easier to scale cat in the future
Added basic expression system to cat in EVA (they react to acceleration)
Kitten fur length and fur LOD speed are now values calculated based on the scale of the kitten. This means that fur length will appear consistent regardless of how big or small the cat is, aswell as ensuring the LOD system works as intended on large kittens as previously larger kittens would have very few fur shells due to the LOD system expecting the kitten to be a specific size.
Added procedural small craters to the Moon.
Added size variation parameter to the existing procedural craters modifiers, allowing crater size randomization.
Allowed terrain gradient strength parameter to affect all modifier gradient output, not just the initial height gradient.
Added CPU gradient evaluation for the simple craters modifier.
Moved orbit line transparency and darkening from CPU to GPU.

Fixed incorrect PBR material setup on the kittens. This was caused by either glbs missing the RMA textures, or fragment shaders expecting textures to be formatted as ORM instead of RMA.
Updated kitten space suit to use white suit variation.
Reverted unintended change from updating the ground clutter where the terrain heightmap was always being sampled with mip 0.
Fixed inverted normal axis on kitten suit and MMU.
Shadow rendering WIP

Tweaks to MMU thrusters. These are nowhere near final and are still visually mis-aligned. They will need to be until we complete Mass implementation to parts.
Moved the first Kitten to ever EVA down near the Gemini Capsule vehicles. - PHew that was close. Nearly gave away his real name there in the commit message.
Added simple rim lighting on kitten fur. The intensity is expected to be tweaked after kittens have shadows implemented properly.

Fixed disconnected Ap markers being drawn in UI on orbits where start TA < -Pi.
Static meshes cast sun shadows
Fixed multisampling crash for shadows
Catch exceptions thrown in the vehicle update task so that we receive the error messages outside of the debugger.
Added 3 new idle animations for the kitten with MMU. Currently only idle 1 is used, however idles 2 and 3 are ready to be setup once a system for switching between idles gets implemented.

Fixed error/potential crash? when creating or changing burns and there is a past burn still in the flightplan. This was causing the worker task to try and update the old burn and being unable to find a valid flightplan.
Fixed crash in Transfer Planner when you set the minimum time to a ridiculously low number.
Fix star reflections not appearing on a lower part of a planet surface (e.g. a crater). Intersections with the Earth for reflections are now approximated using a smaller sphere which is 90% of the original planet radius so that we don't get intersections from every angle when at points which are lower than the planet surface. This inaccuracy will look fine and be unnoticable as it is on reflections.
Fixed text in key bindings UI. "/" is actually set sim speed to default. Not set sim speed to zero.
Cut sample vehicle main engine thrust by a factor of 5 to make landings easier. Good luck with your Jupiter launches!
Fixed an error where XML enging thrust would not be obeyed unless it was specified in base Newtons.
Corrected the BACK attitude button tooltip's notion of up direction.
Made the TWR tooltip more precise - it is the thrust-to-weight at the surface of the currently-orbited body.
Fixed some issues with the sun 'flickering' on and off. Known regression of sun's depth not being properly respected.
Turned off some of the sunbloom logic as it was causing the sun to disappear at some angles.
Removed mod.toml dependency for certain graphics settings. These settings are now setup to use Enums defined in GameSettings.cs. Previously we we're saving the direct values for settings in the settings.toml file, however as settings values are changing so frequently during this stage in development we are now only saving Low/Medium/High which will internally map to actual numbers. While this does mean that players will loose the ability to edit mod.toml and change what values Low/Medium/High is mapped to, it means that if we drastically change how a value is used internally then players will still experience a stable game instead of constantly needing to revert their settings to fix visual artifacts, performance or any potential bug that could be caused by internally changing how a variable is used.
Cat fur quality is now initalized to the intended default value, 32, instead of 256. This was caused by how settings we previously implemented which meant that quality settings and the default value had no dependency on one another resulting in fur quality settings getting adjusted but not the default value.
Added a few more loading tags for clarity.
Fix shader hot reloader and file watcher turning on during startup even when the setting was off.
Added game settings version number. Currently this doesn't do anything but in the future it will give us more options around updating settings and how we communicate changes to the player.
Kitten fur now renders from front to back instead of back to front.
Fixed a case where flight computer outputs might not be cleared, leading to potentially firing the wrong thrusters or waking up too frequently.
Fixed broken shadow map settings introduced in the settings overhaul I did earlier.
Added ability to define FxLocation and FxExhaustDirection separate from Force Location and Direction in thruster definitions.

Fix vessel lighting using atmospheric transmittance when atmosphere is disabled
Add time switch shader function to alternate between different pieces of shader code for testing / debugging. The function is currently unused but will be used later as the code has been used a lot in the past for a temporary test.
Shader hot reloader fixes and improvements.
Tidier wording on logged messages on shader hot reload
Fixed runtime shader files not hot reloading
Make Filepath.IsRuntimePath() use AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory instead of a "/bin/" string.
Add more shader files to be hot reloaded by recompiling them on frame rebuild
Disable shader hot reloader in production due to file permissions needed in the build to save shader files. Enabling file permissions here is too risky for users.
Change Filepath.CorrectSeparators to not use "this" input argument. This makes the function more flexible if people want to compare the uncorrected path with the corrected path, instead of modifying the string when calling the function.
Fixed to ensure you cannot create a Burn on a stale flightplan. eg: A Burn's flightplan that is old (in the past).
Added screen notifications when you try to create a Burn on a stale flightplan to inform you why it has not created a burn in this case.
Fixed potential invalid burn/patch processing when updating the Burn Plan for a vehicle by ensuring the Vehicle's Flight Plan is also updated first before updating the Burn Plan.
Smoothed out animation inputs so Hunter's MMU animation is less jittery
Changed RadixSorter to use stackalloc rather than creating an array to reduce heap allocation. This will limit the size of the inSource.
Added/updated fuel tank parts. They should all now have Attach Nodes.

Tuning of animation blending speeds for MMU (Still very WIP)
Added a setting so you can permanently toggle the map grid on or off.
Fixed a case where vehicles out of proximity to other vehicles would have their flight computers dispatched twice on the first update step. As a side effect, this prevented thruster pulse mode from functioning.
Begin pulling Kitten into the mod system. Values previously hardcoded, are now read from CharacterAssets.xml. This means that custom animations and character meshes can be used instead of the default kitten. Custom textures are not yet implemented into the mod system for the kittens.
Converted kitten meshes from glb to gltf. This means that the kitten's textures are no longer packed directly into a glb, exposing the textures to make updating and modifying textures much easier.
Added Albedo and NormalMap indices to CharacterAsset.xml. This is used to inform which albedo/normalmap textures are mapped to the kittens head, and lets us reuse those textures for the kittens fur to make the transition from headmesh to kitten fur as seamless as possible.
Fixed ability to see through the oceans and Earth and into the stars behind at some heights above the ocean surface. This should also fix some of the MSAA related issues on some AMD cards. Oceans can be less performant on higher MSAA settings now. This does not completely fix the 'White Earth' problem on some AMD cards but you should be able to see the land now without having to turn off the oceans.
Fixed crash when issueing meshes console command.
Kittens now use ORM textures instead of RMA. This brings us in line with gltf texture standards. This update will be done to vessels shortly.
Vessel material textures updated to ORM format
Added Shift-E hotkey for Editor toggle.
Added Vehicle constructor that allows root part and orbit to be passed in instead of constructing these from the vehicle template.
Added ability to create separate vehicles from UnattachedPartTrees in the VehicleEditor. You can create new vehicles now from unattached part trees by setting the Create New Vehicle toggle in part UI within the vehicle editor.
Added ability to change the assigned vehicle on a part. But just setting this will not magically move the part to another Vehicle.
Added Kitten shader references to DefaultAssets.xml. Previously shaders were hardcoded inside the different renderers for the kitten, however now they are properly exposed.
Enabled backface culling on the kittens, previously culling was disabled.
Assorted kitten animation parameters now have the required flag, to ensure that data gets pulled in from the mod library properly in the future.
Fixed an inconsistency in how eccentricity is computed from state vectors which could cause an out-of-domain acos calculation for nearly-circular orbits.
Moved KittenFur into kittens gltf, instead of existing outside of any asset description as a global texture. While this doesn't mean much right now, its a step towards detangling the kittens current implementation to make multiple unique kittens possible in the future.
KittenFur is now a png again, when it was converted to a dds, it was exported as an SRGB meaning the kitten fur length and coverage weren't true to the created mask. As a result the cat now looks fluffier. Expect the kitten fur mask to be re-compressed soon, with proper settings.

Add pbr spheres toggle in the debug menu for testing material roughness and metalness in our shaders. This allows us to thoroughly test our lighting shaders to ensure there are no problems when importing art assets.
Fixed issue where certain parabolic orbits were being classified as hyperbolic resulting in invalid Mean Anomaly Calculations. Because Mean Anomaly doesn't exist on a parabolic orbit.
In addition, cleaned up some GetOrbitType and Orbit classification methods and removed IsCircular (as this is not even relevant or used).
Modified our old Gltf Xml tag to be more explicitly named 'Mesh Atlas'
Updated engines to have Attach Nodes. Still need to make them fit snug and give connectors sizing.
Fixed loaded vehicles not having their parts load connectors properly. Connectors are not actually connecting to eachother on preloaded vehicles (yet).
Fixed the color of the nose tank on the default geminis.
Made 'Snapping' and 'Connecting' flags in the debug editor mutually exclusive as they don't work properly together (yet).
Fixed some snapping bugs in the debug editor that caused children in an unattached tree to be translated incorrectly.
Kitten idle action animations now delay after playing an MMU animation, this prevents the kittens from blending halfway into an idle animation.
Kitten idle delay now respects simulation time. Previously the kitten would only play an idle action animation after 45 seconds, regardless of how fast the simulation speed was.
Properly setup idle action animation timings. Previously the duration to play the idle action animation for was estimated, however it is now properly calculated based on the animation data. This means that custom idle animations will now play for the correct duration, aswell as idle action animations not entering a state where they can play multiple times within one 'allocated' time frame.
Separated references to SubParts from their definitions. This helps prevent duplicate definitions and allows us to give each SubPart instance its own ID separate from the template ID.
Moved all inline-defined SubParts out into their own definitions.
Kitten idle action animations now read from a list that gets initialized from the CharacterAssets.xml. Previously the two idle action animations were hardcoded, but now idle action animations can be easily added or removed using only the xml with no defined limit on how many can be added.
Added current position point into the orbit lines for Celestials (just like it does for vehicles already). This fixes misaligned orbit lines from the celestial body - particularly the larger the orbit.
The kitten no longer always looks at you. If you are far away the kitten will stop looking at you, aswell as alternating every few seconds between looking forwards and looking at you. This is a very basic implementation and I expect it to be changed or atleast adjusted later on.
General code cleanup for CharacterRenderer.cs.
Modified fullscreen/borderless/windowed modes to work more as you would expect them to. Turned off ImGui popout windows when in fullscreen.
Refactor to animation loading scheme, in order to allow more explicit references to animation skeletons
Skeletal animation reference cleanup
Reduced kitten fur length. This overall improves the quality of the fur by bringing the effect closer to the underlying head-mesh.
Merged FramePackedVkBuffer into TransientVkBuffer
Converted all usages of FramePackedVkBuffer to TransientVkBuffer
Fixed fur rim light darkening fur on low quality. This was caused by the calculated ratio being negative for the very low quality option.
Updated the Command and Passage parts with Attach Nodes.
Updated the Service Module parts with Attach Nodes.
Removed duplicate Editor Toggle menu button.
Fixed some of the problems with gizmo rendering on older AMD cards. The Burn Node should no longer create crazy artifacts. The Sphere of Influence visualizer still causes crazy visual snow.

Moved default ImGui font to the KSA project
Added ability to reference bones by name
Complete overhaul of how rocket engines of all types work in KSA.
Rockets are now split into controllers, rockets, cores, and nozzles. Cores consume propellant and produce energetic gases which are ducted into Nozzles to produce thrust. Each Rocket is exactly one Core feeding one or more Nozzles. Controllers issue coordinated commands to one or more Rockets.
Controllers, Rockets, Cores, and Nozzles can be spread to various parts of the XML tree to play better with the emerging part/sub-part system.
The initial type of core is currently the Combustor. This uses a CombustionProcess to turn propellant into exhaust gases via a chemical reaction.
Combustors are more efficient at higher chamber pressures, leading to efficiency losses when throttling.
The initial type of nozzle is currently the DeLavalNozzle. This is a fixed-geometry nozzle which turns low-velocity, high-pressure, high-enthalpy gas into high-velocity, low-pressure, low-enthalpy exhaust.
Nozzle thrust is now composed of both momentum thrust and pressure thrust, leading to variable thrust (and therefore specific impulse) depending on ambient pressure.
Implemented a SubstanceLibrary which contains both the Substances and the CombustionProcesses used by Combustors.
Added a few initial combustion processes and their supporting substances: Hydrogen+Oxygen, Kerosene+Oxygen, MMH+NTO, and one more exotic type.
Added TemperatureReference and MolarMassReference.
KNOWN ISSUE: Nozzles can produce zero thrust at high ambient pressure, will be resolved with a simple model for flow separation.
KNOWN ISSUE: Kittens, old Gemini, and old Apollo thrusters are inactive while I finish converting the XML.
KNOWN ISSUE: Thrust editor is non-functional while I convert it to use the new data types.
Fixed odd connection behaviors in the vehicle editor when a child part is in the vehicle's part tree but not using its connector.
Deleted the old broken thrust editor but made the related exhaust overlay easier to access (View -> Debug -> Show Engine Debug).
Packed the radius of the sun into SunPosition in the UboLightingData
Changed calculations for celestial eclipsing shadows to factor in sun radius.
Fixed orbit lines for satellites and minor bodies would render no matter what. This meant that at large celestial body counts, too many distant orbit lines would be drawn. This work was identified by Brian Thrain and tomservo, who have made an excellent website to generate system mods. This will be the subject of a developer update. Their work allowed us to test large data easily.
Increased the maximum number of orbit lines to allow very large celestial object counts for modding.
Added new celestial body types to help with interface drawing. PlanetaryBody, Asteroid, MinorBody, and others. These will be expanded and grown to influence their visuals and behaviors, but their addition now allows modders (and our artists) to make use of them.
Split out the ShouldDrawUiOrLines to have a wrapped function ShouldDrawLines. This means for some bodies (such as minor ones), we might draw the name but not the orbit lines. For major bodies, there is no change.
Unified the coloring for the boxes and the text, as it was disjointed seeing them different. This needs some tweaking, but is a visual improvement for now.
Fixed some of the template classes were not using correct inheritance, strictly speaking, although this wasn't causing any issues I could see for now.
Fixed issue where templates were not being loaded as their correct inherited class due to use of new rather than override. Only affected the visual template for interface.
Added user can set the amount of 'orbit solvers', which are worker threads doing orbital and physics work. This will default to half the number or cores a user has, exceeding the amount of cores will reduce efficiency.
Fixed inconsisent tooltip implementation methods.
Fixed I did not use the orbit line color for vessel name and box coloring, which would mean colorblind support settings were ignored.
Added tooltip when hovering over celestial interface box, indicating how to set/unset target and focus camera. Credit: NoMrBond.
Added Orbit Solver now shows the amount of processors available in the settings screen, so users can't accidentally set more than are available.
Ported kitten EVA thrusters to the new rocket system.
Fixed a case where the flight computer could produce a NaN if a thruster was configured for an axis in which it had zero authority.

Fixed the computation of control authority for kitten EVA thrusters, thus re-enabling flight computer control of the kittens.
Implemented a simple nozzle flow separation model to prevent nozzle thrust from becoming zero or negative. This also produces a flow separation severity metric which we can use to drive separation-induced engine damage in the future.
Removed some old state from the now-deleted thrust editor.
Changed BodyTemplate optional in Astronomical class, so Vehicles can have them optional.
Removed GaugeCanvas references from VehicleTemplate and vehicle definitions in XML files, they are now referenced via statics in the GaugeCanvas class.
Removed VehicleTemplate reference from Vehicle class. A Vehicle can still be built from a VehicleTemplate but we no longer store and reference the template after the instance is created. This will allow us to serialize vehicles now without the need of a template.
PSA: THIS CHANGE WILL BREAK ALL EXISTING SAVE Files!!!! That is your one and only warning. Also, there is further changes coming very soon that will break them again as we look to serialize and deserialize vehicles and parts.
Fixed issue when trying to delete save files that are under Windows OneDrive sync would fail and crash the game.

Destroy existing vehicles and kittens before loading a save, the restore them from the individual save - no templates or existing vehciles required.
Added ability to deserialize vehicles and kittens from save files and correctly find and reference their template parts and subparts from the ModLibrary. This is a big step forward in our serialization capability for save files.
Added ability to create completely new vehicles in the dev part editor and be able to serialize them out into save files and reload those save files.
PSA: THIS CHANGE WILL BREAK ALL EXISTING SAVE Files Again!!!!
Replace all "string" usages in ImGui with our new ImString type
Removed the wind sound from the save file. Not necessary to serialize this out.

Version 2025.12.3.2971
Corrected the orientation of the Celestial-Centered Inertial frame (CCI) so that the X vector points to the vernal point instead of the periapsis.
Renamed rotation-related XML parameters in the astronomical XML to be more clear (Period -> RotationPeriod, Retrograde -> RetrogradeRotation).
Added an InitialRotation XML parameter for astronomicals.
Added a missing function in IReferenceFrames.
Reverted 90-degree rotation of the vernal point axis. Instead, simply change the AxialTilt axis to be the inertial X axis instead of the Y axis, which was the correct thing to do in the first place.
Added a first pass to make attach nodes unusable if something is in the way.
Added ability to not register an Astronomical to the System in constructor.
Added VehicleSaveData, VehicleSave, UncompressedVehicleSave and VehicleSaves classes to process Vehicle save files.
Changed GameSave class to be more abstract so that VehicleSave can also inherit and implement.
Added ability to process UncompressedVehicleSave meta data in SaveMetaData class.
Added ability to Create a Vehicle Save file via Part context menu in the Developer Vehicle Editor Tool. Vehicle saves are written to "vehicles" folder next to the "Saves" folder.
Added ability to Right click in Developer Vehicle Editor Tool to open Load Vehicle dialog to load a vehicle save into the Developer Vehicle Editor Tool.
Added a first pass on deep copying Part Trees.
Added PartReference to store per instance data for Parts. Switched over XML for vehicles to utilize it.
Fixed updated bounding boxes for Parts when leaving the debug editor.
Primitive fix to descriptor set validation errors when exiting the editor.
Fixed offset issue on newly created vehicles.
MAde the Developer VEhicle Editor window a better starting size so it doesn't start outside of the main game window.
Added the ability to set XML orbital elements in the ecliptic frame as well as the equatorial frame. This will help modders import real-world object ephemerides.
Moved XML orbital elements into a new <Orbit> sub-tag. The definition frame is set by <Orbit DefinitionFrame="X">, where X is either Equatorial (default) or Ecliptic.
Removed hidden derived orbital quantites from the XML templates as they need outside context (e.g. the parent) to be computed properly. These should now be obtained by creating an OrbitData struct.
Removed several OrbitData constructors to try and consolidate the now-redundant multiple ways to create this data.
Updated Earth and Luna ephemerides to 2025-11-30.
Deleted unused EarthMercuryLoveJoy.xml.
Fixed an issue causing the interstellar objects to not load orbits correctly.
Fix sun visible through clouds with MSAA due to the latest MSAA transparencies changes
Converted SunShadowRenderers to use Bindless Textures
Renamed Shadows.glsl to SunShadows.glsl, making it more descriptive.
Added GpuTextureSystem to descriptor layouts that use SunShadowRenderer.
Added ComputeBit to StageFlags in BindlessTexture
Fixed potential duplicate vehicle names when creating new ones in the editor.
Moved the starting vehicles and kittens into the daylight at game start.
Fixed vehicle target orbit being drawn when not in map mode.
Corrected minor console command pluralization issue.
Fixed issue where BoundingBoxVehicleBody needs to be recomputed now when creating a new vehicle.
Fixed SoI transparency levels.
Removed the IOrbit interface as it was hiding straightforward data retrieval behind virtual functions and forcing the code to make up values that couldn't be computed in some cases. If orbital data is required, one should now access the appropriate Orbit or OrbitData object.
Mesh rendering reorganisation: position data in dedicated buffer for more performant depth passes
Reduced VRAM usage on shared buffers

Version 2025.12.2.2991
Corrected the rotation order of axial alignment and axial tilt so that alignment happens first, as it was supposed to.
Corrected the value of Earth's axial alignment to match the eclitpic frame.
Added documentation to many places in Rocket.cs.
Minor stylistic and warning/suggestion improvements.
Pulled all planetary body rotation parameters into a <Rotation> XML tag, similar to <Orbit>.
The Rotation tag now supports a DefintionFrame. By default it is Perifocal, but can also be set to Ecliptic.
Renamed rotation-related XML tags: RotationPeriod -> SiderealPeriod, AxialTilt -> Tilt, AxialAlignment -> Azimuth, TidallyLocked -> IsTidallyLocked, RetrogradeRotation -> IsRetrograde.
Replaced InitialRotation with InitialParentFacingLongitude which will automatically take into account the body's true anomaly, making it easy to orient the body in the correct initial direction.
Draw CCI axes in addition to CCF axes in the celestial info panel.
Assigned JPL Horizons ephemerides to most major bodies.
Removed MeanAnomalyAtEpoch XML tags which have been ignored for a very long time. Orbit epcoh is specified with TimeAtPeriapsis.
Moved Orbit off of AstronomicalTemplate since Astronomicals don't neccsarily have orbits.
Fixed issue where encounters were not being passed back from worker in the Transfer Planner due to some stack alloc improvements Dean had done. So now transfers are less broken than they were for the past week or two. Phew. That was a tough one. As the stack alloc is only thrown away when the thread is terminated, which was leading me on a bit of a goose chase.
Fixed Imgui errors with duplicate labels when displaying subparts lists in the vehicle editor UI.
Integrate Brutal.Monitor into KSA for collecting Crash dumps, writing Logs to file and possibly more features in the future
Logs are written to My Games/Kitten Space Agency/Logs
Crash dumps require the "dotnet-dump" tool for collection. If this is
installed they will be output to My Games/Kitten Space Agency/CrashDumps
Added "openlogs" and "opencrashdumps" for easy navigation to these
files
Added a first pass on mirrored editing in the debug editor. It will break very easily in its current state.
Upped the scaling on the transform gizmos in the debug editor as their meshes were downscaled at some point and they never got resized.
Imported first set of fairing/interstage parts.
One last revision to rotation tilt & azimuth to correct the insidious azimuth reversal.
Fixed solar system rotation azimuth data.
Added a VolumeReference class to define volumes on parts (storage).
Added gas phases to substances.
Added gaseous H2 and O2.
Added an estimated VRAM usage indicator while loading for systems that support it. It's only an estimate and reports what the driver tells us for our memory budget. Dean promises he'll make it look nicer SoonTM.

Version 2025.12.14.3000
Removed Vulkan API version setting option as 1.2 vs 1.3 hasn't seem to come up with resolving compatibility issues and only supporting 1.3 gives us a consistent feature set to build on. If your GPU driver does not support 1.3 you should try updating your drivers. If that fails, your GPU manufacturer is almost 4 years late on updating their driver implementation.
Updated kitten to new version. This updated kitten has more bones allowing for additional animation options such as resizing the kittens pupils. This new version also seperates eye and head materials, allowing for easy swapping between the kittens eye colors as previously the head and eye textures were shared.
Implemented a character avatar system. This is a backend definition of the kitten which consolidates all aspects of what a kitten is, aswell as allowing a cohesive system for generating random kittens in the future. (Although random kittens are not yet supported the character avatar is an important step towards this).
Removed LoadedCharacterRenderRef, this is now a redundant system which was previously abstracting how meshes were loaded. Its functionality has been merged into the character avatar system.
Character modding overhaul. Previously every kitten had to be fully redefined, however in XML a character is now broken up into different descriptions (CharacterCore, CharacterTextures, MMUAnimations, CharacterFur etc). This allows for easier modding aswell as additional character parameters getting exposed, such as fur length.
Character animations have been completely re-exported, stripping out any redundant data that might be stored in the glbs. This has reduced the total file sizes of the animations by ~18Mbs. All animations also needed to be exported for the new version of the kitten.
Added new kitten facial expressions, with support for multiple variations of expressions to be loaded. This can be showcased with the kittens new 'personality' attribute.
Adjusted the kittens look at behaviour to introduce a very basic eye saccades system. This helps to remove the death stare that was previously present.
Removed gltf texture dependency for kitten textures. Previously the kittens textures were tied directly into the gltf, however they are now properly seperated allowing for easier modding and texture swapping.
Removed alpha discard check from ModelPbr.frag.
Converted kitten textures from png to ktx2.
The character renderer now uses a repeat sampler instead of a clamped sampler to fix some artifacts present on mirrored parts of the kitten.
Fixed a bug that prevented the fur material from reading directly from the head material. This means the characters fur no longer needs to index directly into the gltf to get the characters normal map.
Created proper textures for the glass visor. Previously the roughness and metallic values were hardcoded inside ModelGlass.frag. The visors ORM has now been edited to have the desired values.
Removed kitten pngs. Due to a small bug present the gltf texture references have been replaced with 2x2 placeholder images. This is only temporary.
Character attachments now properly support custom textures. This means that one shared mesh can be used with different textures, similar to how the kitten is implemented currently.
Fixed text on MMU not rendering correctly.
Changes to move total propellant capacity by mass from a made up number at a vehicle level to a real value based on the volume of all the sub parts in a vehicle.
Remove PropellantMassCapacity from VehicleSaves. This is replaced with SubstanceStorageVolume at the subpart level.
Changed it so you must use a Method to change the SubPart list in a Part instance. This is so we can cache values for the part.
Added CombustionProcess.GetLiquidMassByVolume so we can easily get the mass of a liquid for a Combustion Process by volume.
Added SubstanceStorageVolume to SubPartTemplate and SubPart classes. Pre-populated values into existing sub part tank definitions. These probably need a second pass on their values.
Added PartTree.SubstanceStorageVolume to store the total storage by volume of all the parts in the Tree.

Fixed VolumeReference string conversion.
Converted several unit powers to fancy superscripts in string printouts.
Reverted test XML with mm^3 volume.
Kitten fur mask can now be defined directly in xml.
Character attachment system now supports multiple materials. This means that the MMU now goes through the proper texture system. MMU textures have also been compressed to ktx2 as a result.
Added character cosmetic attachment system. While this is not currently used in game, it allows for additional meshes to be attached to characters as defined in XML.
Fixed bug that would sometimes give Hunter wrong fur material
Fixed Vulkan crashing the app on startup 1/4-5 times under Linux.
Re-adding Brutal.Monitor after fixing issues with the Subprocess in packaged/installed builds of KSA
Re-revert Brutal.Monitor. It crashes for some people on some platforms
This reverts commit 0a3aff06d35d39169c28e2811390c1050867da25.
Added a system for generating a random kitten. This system is not currently used in the game, however it allows us to generate a randomized kitten based on data defined in XML, instead of needing to explicitly define a kitten everytime we want to generate one. As part of this, attachments and gltfs can now explicitly have their usage or attachment type explictly defined inorder to help the kitten generator determine the different usecase of assets.
Removed excessive logging caused when loading the kitten.

Add WIP sun surface rendering code. The sun surface rendering is currently turned off as it is WIP. The sun is rendered as a mesh, and shader code was written for Fractal brownian motion and the plasma waves.
Fix mesh bucketing system bug with drawing the sun sphere
Fixed a case where vehicles could be taken off rails when chaning SOIs but then updated as if they were on rails, confuisng the situation system and leading to an "updating from out-of-date states" error.
Seperated kitten eye animations from expression animations. Previously the two systems were linked meaning the more facial expressions the more redundant eye animations would get recalculated.
If the kitten is looking at you, its eyes will no longer follow you when the simulation is paused.
Correctly scaled the kittens MMU and Visor mesh. Previously we were fixing scaling issues by re-sizing them before rendering the mesh. They have now been re-exported at the correct scale.
Fixed broken eye saccades
Updated all SubParts to have collision meshes. Some do not have collision meshes and are being assumed as non-colliding for the time being.
Removed some old debug code.
Imported new attachable rocket booster parts. They do not function yet.
Character attachments now support individual transformations via XML.
Removed AllowEmbedded flag from kitten gltf meshes in XML. The option has not been removed, only its use cases.
Deleted placeholder textures for gltfs. These are now redundant as we no longer even attempt to load them.
Minor cat code cleanup
Fixed some legacy GC stuff that was breaking saves
Fix sun surface transform being updated on unused viewports. This code will be refined later.
Added ResourceManager class and instance on each Vehicle. This class will manage all resources. As a first step it is managing a total resource value for now. But this will be further broken down into subpart management.
Added ResourceStates struct and instance onto the KinematicStates (replace old PropellantMass field) - which is supplied from the ResourceManager at the start of a VehicleUpdateTask and given back to the ResourceManager at the end of a VehicleUpdateTask at the start of the next frame.  During the VehicleUpdateTask mass changes /requests will all be processed through the ResourceManager.
Changed refill command to use the new ResourceManager.
Fixed definition of SubstanceStorageVolume, must be part of SubPartGameDataReference and applied to SubPartTemplate.
Added SubstanceStorageVolume definition to the KittenBackPackSubPart.
Added first step (because this will require more work to break down the total value by subparts) serialization and deserialization of VehicleResourceData which is managed through the ResourceManager instance on a Vehicle.
Added MSAA support for Orbit Lines and Gizmos (SoI, Burn Node, translation arrows). As part of this overhaul, Orbit Lines are now added via the static OrbitLinePass Class and a few extra buffer copies have been removed which should slightly speed up the CPU-side orbit line processing.
Enabled synchronization2, dynamic rendering, and sample rate shading vulkan features. Orbit Lines are now drawn via dynamic rendering.
Fixed reloading shaders would cause a crash for sunrenderer. Commented out reloading shaders for now, as we generally don't reload shaders at runtime anyway.

Added an analytic solver for torque-free, asymmetric rigid body rotation. This joins the isoinertial and axisymmetric solvers to cover all possible moment of inertia cases for rigid bodies.
Ground Clutter Developments
Added raytracing support to the ground clutter generator to accelerate object generation.
Added new raytracing glsl include in preparation for ground clutter acceleration structure, currently contains BVH functions for software raycasts.
Created initial acceleration structure setup on CubeMesh, will be moved to a more appropriate location once I get it working.
Enabled the extensions and features required for ray queries.
Enable depth test-write for the ground clutter renderer.
Batch ground clutter generation into one dispatch.
Added batched unloading to the ground clutter renderer.
Added Hanan's custom Allocator for enabling the memory device address bit on acceleration structure resources.
Fixed ground clutter flickering caused by leftover code that clears the counts on the CPU.
Updated descriptor bindings in CubeSphereGrid.cs to support both BVH and Raytracing depending on device support.
Added AccelerationStructureUtils class for managing construction of acceleration structure resources. In the future this may manage the lifetime of the resources too.
Fixed missing disposing of acceleration structure and new ground clutter resources.
Removed Opaque flag from TLAS and BLAS - this was causing ray queries to fail, needs attention in the future.
Added barrier after acceleration structure build.
Generalized RayQueries.glsl so it can be used in other shaders.
Added 'arrow' mesh for debugging ground clutter orientation.
Added 'TransformFunctions.glsl' for handling creation of GPU matrices.
Added 'GroundClutterCommon.glsl'
Added terrain normal alignment to ground clutter.
Refactored CubeCellGrid: Separated ground clutter implementation from CubeCellGrid and moved it to a derived class, making CubeCellGrid a generalized base class in case it's used elsewhere.
Added ground clutter terrain normal alignment to the BVH implementation.
Moved BVH buffer handling off the CubeCellGrid to BoundingVolumeHierarchy so we can share it across all clutter types on a planet.
Cleaned up acceleration structure and BVH creation in CubeMesh.
Avoided re-querying device for raytracing support.
Removed unused ground clutter functions.
Further minor ground clutter code cleanup.
Added color support to the debug gizmo renderer.
Allowed debug gizmos to be queued up from ImGui debug menus.
Refactored BoundingVolumeHierarchy implementation:
Significantly improved BVH build times. Attempted a few schemes - LBVH, SAH splitting, but LBVH had poor traversal times for the planet mesh and SAH took too long to build. Currently sticking with a recursive, partially parallel build.
Significantly improved BVH traversal times by using a better spatial partitioning scheme.
Significantly reduced BVH VRAM usage by passing only the reordered index array to the GPU, rather than the triangle soup. This does not affect existing VRAM usage, as BVHs were never built in production.
Added debug functions for drawing the planetary BVH - Bounds, bounds at depth, and ray trace bounds visualizations.
Reversed planet mesh generation order when loading so the BVH and dense meshes kick off first, potentially improving load speed.
Added ground clutter BVH debug section to the terrain debug menu.
Reordered descriptor writes for the ground clutter generation shader to align with the improved BVH implementation.
Added BVH depth calculation.
Reduced the GPU BVH traversal stack size from 64 to 24.
Made BLAS and TLAS nullable for when there isn't any ground clutter on a planet.
Enabled automatic ray-query support detection.
Fixed BVH access when ray queries are in use in ground clutter renderer.
Only generate acceleration structures for mesh collections that are used on a planet that requires one.
Commented out ground clutter in Astronomicals.xml and re-enabled terrain modifiers for main.
Updated the planet renderer to use bindless textures.
Temporarily removed tiling heightmaps, these were implemented before the modifier system and will be moved to a modiifer rather than being always active with only one heightmap.
Removed now unused texture arrays from the planet renderer since moving to the bindless system.
Fixed Earth cliffs displacement texture not using the correct size. Was 4096 x 4096, now 1024 x 1024.
Added new animation blending system for kitten animations. Previously only a single animation was active at once, however we can now blend between multiple animations using a position on a tetrahedron. This is currently utilized for the kittens MMU animations.
Removed emissive getting multiplied by x12 in Mesh.frag
Doing some maintenance on the part template system before starting the great mass properties migration.
Merged (Sub)PartTemplate and (Sub)PartGameDataReference so that we only need to maintain one copy of this code.
Removed the template Get() functions and just return the template directly since it should be fully-prepared.
Renamed (Sub)PartReference to (Sub)PartInstance.
Renamed (Sub)Part.Id to (Sub)Part.InstanceId.
Renamed (Sub)Part.Name to (Sub)Part.DisplayName.
Fixed gizmos in the editor not rendering properly when multisampled antialiasing was enabled.

Eliminate redundant combustor entries on the kitten MMU - all thrusters can share a single entry because we copy it when converting to runtime entities anyway.
Added terrain normal alignment to ground clutter.
Ground clutter is now able to sample the exact terrain height, processing the procedural modifiers. This results in a second compile of HeightFuncs.glsl which is slow on AMD due to the switch-case.
Added automatic shader compilation depending on whether ray queries are supported or not. If supported, a global macro 'RAY_QUERIES_SUPPORTED' is defined for shaders.
Removed unused ground clutter functions.
Removed unused 'meshTriangleIndex' field from ground clutter ObjectData struct.
Added new graphics section "Terrain".
Added new graphics setting "Ground Clutter", off by default while it's WIP.
Moved terrain tessellation graphics setting into the ground clutter section.
Moved ground clutter renderer out of main Program into PlanetRenderer.
Removed Multisampling from AMD 5000 and 6000 series GPUs. There are currently severe graphical artifacts caused by Multisampling on these GPUs.
Added serialization and deserialization of InstanceId of parts and subparts into game save files. This will allow us to identify the correct instances of parts and subparts for serialization of additional data at the part and subpart level.

Allows clouds to cast shadows and godrays over large distances and different layers to shadow each other, improves the cloud lighting greatly and sunsets look so much better now. Clouds shapes and types will need a rework to take advantage of the new lighting. Also a good candidate for async compute.

Sample aerial perspective LUTs using bicubic to fix linear interpolation artifacts visible with strong mie scattering and godrays
Fix validation errors about mismatching formats with MSAA transparencies textures when MSAA is disabled
Suppress warning about save data being invalid - this is because the prebuilt vehicles have not had storage defined to them yet.
Suppress this warning as well, same reason.
Fixed orbit lines overdrawing when toggling UI on and off.
Imported new PropulsionA textures and corrected positions of SRBs.
Added an optional solution filter for a minimal build of KSA to speed up start times by not compiling unreferenced projects and tests.
Fixed kittens letting go of the MMU handles when using the MMU.
Updated Hunter to be a bengal with dark green eyes. Hunters previous textures have not been deleted, and are still available in the project.

Added Mole class to manage storage of liquid substances by mass in TankState instances.
Added TankState class to manage the Mole instances and consumption and production of liquid substances in a TankState.
Added TankState instance to each SubPart instance that has storage capacity.
Added serialization and deserialization of Moles/TankStates at a SubPart instance level so save games now save and load liquid substances.

First steps towards moving all mass properties from Vehicle down into Parts.
Separated the new Assembly Frame (ASMB) from the Body Frame (BODY). BODY is aligned with ASMB but translated to the center of mass.
Added many extension methods to float3x3 to work with inertia tensors.
Removed old empty MatrixEx file.
Added new MassProperties and OffsetMassProperties which track total mass and a full inertia tensor rather than just the principal moments.
For the moment, propellant mass distribution is assumed to match static mass distribution. This needs to be updated to take the actual liquid slug location and shape into account.
Added new CustomMass XML elements to Parts and SubParts.
Removed Mass and MassSpecificPMI from VehicleTemplate.
Moved Mass from AstronomicalTemplate to CelestialTemplate.
Removed some flight computer serialization fields that get recomputed on deserialization anyway.

Added just barely enough masses to parts to make the existing vehicles not break.
Re-add Brutal.Monitor again with fixes and thread-safe logging
Reimplement KeyHash to be allocation free
Change use cases of 'uint' as a hash type to use 'KeyHash' instead
KeyHash now using one stack (or else rented) allocation instead of two rented ones
I lied before when I said it was allocation free; I should have said
heap-allocation free... But that's also not accurate.
It's now stack allocated 99% of the time, and heap allocated 1% of the
time; but in the situations where it's heap allocated, it's at least
rented from a pool so it shouldn't be churning garbage.
Fixed issue where we were getting into an infinite fuel situation when the tanks ran dry.
Consolidated some of the resource manager and tank states code.
Reduce GC pressure from VehicleUpdateTask by implementing the IDisposable pattern to return arrays, rather than waiting for the finalizer.
Removed old version of the ground clutter generate push constant struct.
Removed unused ground clutter generate push constant data.
Fixed ground clutter generate push constant using the range of the old struct rather than the new one.
Fixed crash when enabling or disabling something other than ground clutter in the settings if ground clutter is enabled.
Generalized BVH construction and GPU traversal by introducing an Origin param and building without a transformation applied to re-center.
Fixed precision issues with ground clutter. Rather than outputting positions in Ccf space (very far from origin) now output the direction and the terrain altitude excluding radius, then transform by the Ccf2Ego matrix with origin shift. This ends up performing a similar transformation to what the planet mesh vertices experience, but because clutter is not generated each frame we must store in the rotated Ccf frame rather than mesh space.
Bvh lookups now output the primitive ID rather than triangle ID to align more closely with raytracing lookups.
Added mesh normals support to the gizmo renderer.
Added a bool 'BillboardSnapThisFrame' to the planet renderer which will be used in the future to kick off clutter regeneration when the mesh snaps for small objects that rely hugely on being exactly positioned on the terrain mesh.
Added 'forceUpdate' bool to CubeCellGrid which forces a full re-evaluation of the grid.
Fix memory leak in animation blending due to missing 'using' on SpanOwner
Reduce allocations in blending function from o(n) to o(1)
Add Resource UI window, toggled via Debug Menu or F6 hotkey.

Set editor camera reference frame to chase (BODY).
Offset editor camera from BODY into ASMB so that it does not move with the center of mass.
Update editor before updating the camera because it can affect the center of mass and thus part of the camera target.
Changed Vehicle.CenterOfMassAsmb to return a double3 and made a float3 version (Vehicle.CenterOfMassAsmbF).
First pass on sun surface rendering. A ray marched plasma waves shader is used to give an orange look. This shader is faded in with the existing sunbloom as you zoom in. The plasma waves move very slowly, but can be sped up in the shader.
Fix sunbloom shader squashing near the sides of the camera by using correct perspective projection.
Fix sunbloom occlusion map not using perspective projection.
Fix sun surface shader hot reloader

Version 2025.12.29.3097
Added solid phases to substances.
Added Aluminum 2014.
Rationalize the Vehicle and Kitten constructors and move some initialization around so we don't get null mass vehicles being created.
Moved the serialization of the tgank states from the ResourceManager to the PartTree so we can have multiple ResourceManagers on a vehicle.
Fix and harden ArrayPoolResult<T> usage. Avoid renting arrays when count == 0, guard Dispose() against null instances, removed unnecessary caching, and switched to ReadOnlySpan<T> for safer source input. Finally added some validation checking.
Fixed issue where followed vehicle will always draw all of it's patches/orbits.
Expanded CustomMasses on Parts and SubParts to be InertMasses and take any MassTemplate.
Added MassGemoetry class to help compute the properties of common analytic shapes.
Added the first two geometric mass XML templates: a solid sphere, and a hollow cylinder.
Added millimeters and centimeters to DistanceReference.
Fixed thruster positions in the engine debug overlay.
Added flow separation severity to the engine debug menu.
Thumbnails are now decoupled from vehicles, solving an issue with requiring the creation of a dummy vehicle to render the parts. It should also solve the initial error spam on startup for mass and principal moments of inertia <= 0. (Note: there is a minor bug where some sub parts are missing from the thumbnail)
Removed reference to ThumbnailRender in SubPartModelRenderer in favour of passing in a render pass and sample count flags.
Removed ThumbnailReference class from PartTemplate file.
Created new code file for ThumbnailReference.
Refactor the transparencies msaa resolve code and move it to its own file. Fix some layout transitions on hardware not using ShaderStorageImageMultisample
Change strategy for generating spaced points to reduce garbage pressure, by utilizing MemoryOwner<T> instead of returning arrays that rely on the GC to clean up later.
Change case of log and crashdump folders
Fixed bug in Resource System not correctly calculating mass fractions when refilling tanks.
Fixed bug in Resource System not adding produced mass when it equalled the capacity of the tank exactly.
Added functions to compute the mass properties of ellipsoidal tank domes and complete tanks.
Added a CylindricalTankMass to the XML.
Fixed cut and paste? error creating the orbit points for a vehicle when deserializing twice. We really only need to do that once.
Fixed potential null ref later when we add other substance phases such as gas.
Added a spherical tank mass.

Version 2025.12.31.3103
Fix crash in CharacterRenderer and SuperMeshRenderSystem when their shaders are changed via the hot reloader, reload their shaders on rebuild
Fixed synchronization issues with ground clutter.
Temporarily disabled ground clutter unloading and let new cells overwrite the old data.
Temporarily padded CellData struct to meet minimum offset requirements. To avoid this, I'm going to move away from dynamic descriptors and use two separate buffers instead.
Removed temporary forced clutter regeneration when new cells are generated. Now, this only occurs when the mesh snaps and new cells without a mesh snap generate only what is required.
Removed double/triple buffering for the instance matrix buffer, it was unneeded as the ground clutter synchronization issues were caused by host-to-device writes.
Moved away from dynamic ubo/storage buffers. They are not as widely supported as just using multiple buffers and come with baggage that makes managing them generally more inefficient. This completes the synchronization fixes.
Fixed NRE when trying to dispose the ground clutter renderer if no clutter exists.
Fixed all celestials orbits not having their points cached - which meant no celestials have orbit lines, in worker from performance changes that were made.

Version 2025.12.33.3123
Fixed all principal mass moments using the Ixx moment when combined (oops).
Tagged a bunch of mass properties methods as readonly.
Renamed a bunch of variables in the vehicle editor which used to be in BODY but are now in ASMB.
Added SituationTemplate and xml file to define starting situations for the prebuilt vehicles. This allows us to define situations other than the prebuilt ones for spawning new vehicles into the game. Also supports spawning vehicles to any defined Locations on any celestials (ie. landed).
Changed prebuit vehicle references to use the new situation templates.
Tone down ambient lighting saturation on meshes
Removed need for Vessel reference in ResourceManager instance so we can go multi-instance for the ResourceManager per consumer/producer.
Replace SubstanceStorageVolumes with Tanks that provide both a volume and a geometry. Not all parts have been converted yet.
Changed a bunch of resource values from double to float since the extra memory bandwidth usage is not neccesary here.
Tank mass properties are not in the correct vehicle location yet because we are dropping the tank state <-> sub part link in PartTree - need to address with with a follow-on commit.
Restored kitten RCS propellant.
Fixed a case where an elliptic integral parameter could go out of domain because we were only clamping positive values.
Fixed a bug where the relation between camera and sun causes NaN transform matrix for thumbnails
Removed camera transform override from ThumbnailReference now that Thumbnail parts are moved in relation to the camera.
Fixed the location of vehicle propellant mass properties.
Reorganized tank data into a static Tank and dynamic TankState.
Deleted ResourceStates.
Create a new copy of the tank states for the worker. NOTE: We don't currently deep copy the moles, so this doesn't actually quite create a new set of states yet.
Turned several parameters into methods with 'Compute' prefixes to indicate that they should not be treated as cheap to access.
Fix horizon discontinuity artifact on atmosphere aerial perspective visible on mountain sides, reintroduced recently by sampling the LUTs using bicubic
Fix all-consuming white orb emanating from the clouds by fixing NaNs in the atmosphere LUT sampling introduced by using bicubic
Minor renames to clarify tank reference frames.
Use full mass properties when precomputing thruster torque rather than just the static mass properties. With shifting centers of mass this whole system needs to be changed, but at least now it's more correct at vehicle initialization.
Added WIP ground clutter GPU driven LOD system. Very barebones currently, still yet to create the appended mesh buffers.
Temporarily coloured ground clutter meshes by their LOD.
Set LOD_COUNT to 5 initially.
Removed unnecessary CellData padding.
Switched tank states to use a sorted list of moles for faster lookups.
Added BiDirectionalGraph<T> class.
Changed Resource manager to build a graph of tanks it can access, for now this is filled by part relationships. But ultimately will be populated by part connectors and stage and flow rules (to be added in future weeks).
Changed ResourceManager from being a single instance on a vehicle to now be an instance on each Nozzle in an engine. This allows the ResourceManager to build a graph of tanks it will draw from based on future stages and flow rules.
Changed the Resource Debug UI to display all ResourceManager instances and their tank graphs.
Changed VehicleUpdateTGask to take a deep copy of TankStates to separate worker thread data from simulation data so the updates to the tanks can be applied at the correct time at the start of the next frame.
Added LOD rendering to the ground clutter renderer.
Added 'SimpleVkMeshAtlas' which compacts multiple meshes into one big mesh for GPU driven rendering.
Added debug number meshes 1 through 5 for testing LODs.
Fixed incorrect ground clutter rotation matrix.
Added ResourceManager into the propellant methods so we can use it's graph to correctly drain tanks in the correct order (still to come).
Changed Physics steps to break up the propellant mass changes by nozzle via it's ResourceManager instance.
Added ResourceManager instance for each Rocket Nozzle.

Version 2026.1.2.3181
Added Connector Ids to all predefined parts connectors. This is so they will be stored into the ModLibrary on startup and we can reference them via connector instances in saved vehciles and saved games.
Added ModLibrary.Get function to be able to retrieve connect templates.
Added serialization of part instances and connector instances into vehicle saves and saved games.
Added renumbering and handling of serialized instance Ids on parts/subparts and connectors if we load a vehicle save with instance Ids already in use.
Moved the enumerator for the Unqiue part, subpart and connector instances to the Universe class and reset it whenever we load a new save game.
Added basic ground clutter frustum culling. Currently does not use a bounding sphere/box to test the extents against the frustum (point for now) - this is next.
Reduced polycounts for the debug text meshes.
Fixed crash when changing graphics settings with ground clutter enabled.
Added indirect dispatch command building stage so we only need to dispatch the reodering stage for objects that survived culling (an optimization).
Removed debug LOD colouration.
Fixed a TODO by renaming the "Tgt" vehicle reference frame to "Dock" (so the XML now matches the code). This will break save games but it will only get more painful the longer we wait.
Fix TGT button on navball.
Skip malformed save games and log an error rather than prevent the game from launching.
Reworked tank and mass class hierarchies to eliminate a bogus set of methods on tanks at the cost of two parsed-but-ignored fields on custom masses.
Reduced rotational inertia for current placeholder mass.
Simplified quaternion construction in asymmetric Euler-Poinsot algorithm.
Added two different Part Connector types, Fixed and Surface.
Added Surface Attachment connectors to all parts, except engines for now.
Added handling of surface attachment connectors to the vehicle editor.
Added a PAF (Principal Axes Frame) computation + cache to KinematicStates. This prepares arbitrary combinations of rigid masses for attitude simulation and control.
Eliminated potential left-handed frame and removed all matrix construction in the Euler-Poinsot algorithm.
Fixed inertia tensor parallel axis transformation error.
Added a mass debug overlay to the physics debug window.
Recompute flight computer authority when refilling consumables. This almost works but is still broken due to the thruster intended torque variable, which needs to be removed now that we have a dynamic center of mass.
Added solid and hollow spheres, cylinders, and cuboids to the library of inert masses.
Fixed connector positions in the vehicle editor.
Added buffer syncing for subpart rendering to guarantee host memory has been flushed before drawing occurs.
Fixed a couple of IMGUI errors in the display of resources UI.
Fixed kittens normal maps being flipped on the x axis.
Fixed situation where player could create invalid parent transfer burns when vehicle already has other active burns that invalidates a parent transfer burn. Instead, now an alert is presented to the player in this situation and prevents the creation of the parent transfer burn node.
Fixed resource graph generation from part tree traversal. This is temp, pending other changes to switch over to part connections.
Added first cut, very rough - resource graph visualisation.
Fixed issue with deserialization of tank states from saves.
Changed PipelineBarrier helper for transitioning image layouts, removing duplicate code and adding missing flags for depth attachments.
Removed cancellation token in thumbnail render as it is not currently async.
Cleaned up the ground clutter renderer descriptor pool and bindings by using the Utils functions available.
Now init shared memory LOD counts in parallel so that each thread in the evaluate compute shader only needs to wait on one iteration rather than the LOD count.
Removed unused transforms count binding from BuildDrawCommands.comp.
Removed unused code in ground clutter renderer.
Replaced Dispatch with DispatchIndirect for ground clutter instance reordering.
Optimized ground clutter draw command generation workgroup efficiency.
Fixed resource graph generation logic.
Added cones and truncated cones to the list of available mass property shapes.
Revert fix to deserialization of tank states and remove a redundant call to part tree instead.
Added part connector serializing.
Added part connectors to the astronomicals xml so they're loaded in properly.
Removed typed part connectors as we're likely going to want to do this a bit differently.
Fixed the Refill command to fill tanks in a balanced even manner.
Added error message to log if we attempt to add a mass to a mole and it doesn't fit the available capacity.
Fixed tank states not being saved and loaded correctly.
Changed the Device Vector to transfer via host memory rather than via command buffer submitted copy commands which seems to fix a few sync problems (mostly in thumbnail generation).
Removed 'character loading' from startup log, to prevent log spam.
Fixed moved resource serialized data for moles not having the ondataload performed to set the initial value from the MassReference.
Added subtract method to float3x3.
Break out integration propellant deltas for easier debugging.
Added initial rendering support for thrusters heating up and glowing. Currently the values to control the thrusters temperature are not tied to anything, so the effect is not visible.
Moved GetThinFilm out of Mesh.frag and into SharedFrag.glsl.
Added new InstancedData type for parts. This instanced data contains the temperature for thrusters aswell as the thickness of the thin film thats built up on the thrusters.
Added DynamicMesh.frag/vert. Thrusters can now be set to use DynamicMesh.frag/vert instead of Mesh.frag/vert due to unique logic and data passed into the shaders.
Added initial heat glow emissive texture for Core_Propulsion_A.
Marked all Core_Propulsion_A assets with 'UsesTemperature'. This file will be overriden and this data will need to be setup correctly for auto-generated files.
Fixed a part snapping problem when vehicle assembly bodies were rotated.
Fixed some connector rotations not offsetting by the assembly frame which was causing the 'blocked' logic to be incorrect.
Fixed audio not working for vehicles on loaded saves.
Fixed camera not being reset on loaded saves to the saved camera settings.
Fixed part thumbnails showing heated version of thrusters
Improve how the emissive glow from hot thrusters are blended into the rest of the shader.
Started work on retaining mirrored part information.
Added a 'remove all' button to the debug editor.
Fixed up normal map implementation in various fragment shaders. This will help reduce bugs caused by normal maps with differing compression types aswell as remove unnecessary copy pasted code.
Removed redundant fragment shader code from DynamicMesh.frag
Moved KinematicStates inertia properties into the extension class so they can return references.
Remove vehicle angular momentum from ejected reaction mass in the velocity verlet integrator to avoid spinning up during burns. The symplectic Euler integrator uses angular velocity rather than angular momentum so does not need this correction term.
Fixed multi-second delay when loading saves.
Small improvements to camera handling when transitioning in/out of the vehicle editor.
Ensure PipelineDynamic gets rebuilt properly in SubPartModelRenderer
Separate bounding sphere debug color from SOI color.
Fixed a bug with propellant deserialization where the root part wouldn't recreate its tank state.
Added VSFB LC-4 and Starbase OLM A landmarks.
Hide teleport-to-landmark debug buttons when the associated celestial does not exist.
Renamed ground clutter 'group' to 'ecotype'.
Reorganized ground clutter renderer to support multiple ecotypes and multiple planets (still WIP).
Fixed validation error on a barrier missing DrawIndirectBit.
Allowed ground clutter cell grid to be created from XML parameters rather than constants.
Fixed ground clutter object separation and generation range XML distance references not being loaded.
Added util function for creating buffer memory barriers.
Pulled unload and generation of ground clutter out of the ecotype render data into the ground clutter renderer.
Completed ground clutter renderer refactor to support multiple ecotypes per celestial and multiple celestials.
Replaced individual staging pools with one to reduce the number of fences waited on during ground clutter setup.
Removed IndirectArgs struct in the ground clutter renderer, replaced with the proper VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand.
More appropriately handle rebuilding of ground clutter frame resources.
Cleaned up unnecessary parameters passed to ground clutter renderer building functions.
Added SubPartReference Ids to the Xml so they can be referenced.
Fixed engine gimbals being in the wrong place in the Xml.
Updated the engine textures while I was there.
Broke the new temperature maps since they need to be handled differently.
Added very WIP symmetry inheritance to the debug editor.
Moved the definitions of the prebuilt vehicles and kittens into separate files so they are handled as normal vehicle saves. They now live in Content/defaultvehicles folder.
Aded DefaultVehicles class to manage above prebuilt vehicle loading.
Added fuel into the prebuilt vehicle saves, and removed the automatic refill when loading prebuilt vehicles.
Consolidated Kitten data elements into Vehicle data elements for save files so we no longer need to maintain two sets of data classes for save data for these objects. This is facilitated through changes in the KittenEva constructors.
Minor changes to Mole serialization to match our patterns (changed name and element to attributes).
Added LoadVesselFromLibrary element to handle loading vehicles from default vehicles files and still support a VehicleTemplate to define starting situation, etc.

Version 2026.1.3.3194
Fixed a couple of longstanding issues with resolving ground contact forces. This does not change the collider geometry (it's still a sphere) but does result in much more stable and coherent contact.
Fixed ground clutter objects spinning around their up axis when the planet is rotating.
Added ground clutter mesh loading from XML.
Heat glow now calculates its color from a LUT instead of reading directly from an RGB texture. This means that we only need to sample a grayscale texture allowing us to pack the heatmap in with the TFI texture, saving memory.
Added initial temperature LUT. This is a placeholder texture that will get changed soon.
TFI now samples from the green channel to give more precision.
Fixed DynamicPipeline getting rebuilt with incorrect shaders.
Slight refactor of thin film interference to remove redundant texture sample now that Heatmap and TFI are packed into one texture.
More WIP work on symmetrical editing in the debug editor. The entirety of a segment should be rotated and positioned correctly for both symmetrical editing and symmetry inheritance.
Fixed some logic that was not filling tanks correctly with the correct rations for defined combustions.
Fixed the stored fuel to correct ratios in the prebuilt vehicles and kittens.
Added an Empty <vehicle> command to complement the Refill <vehicle> command.
Second attempt to fix the ratios as per preivous commit. Hopefully this time my maffs is maffsing.
Mirrored parts can now inherit symmetry. Lots more to do here and the code is super dirty. We'll see what horrible edge cases people find.
Updated temperature LUT to match original RGB texture colours. This means the new LUT implementation of the heat glow effect matches ~1:1 with the original implementation.
Added new Heat and TFI packed texture, compressed to ktx2.
Removed RGB emissive texture for CorePropulsionA.
Process resource consumption and production using the ResourceManager graph nodes if present, and if present process in nearest to farthest order spreading the consumption/production evenly across all edges for each node.
Reverse the graph processing order. So by default we will process furtherest nodes from the Consumer first to the closest last. And Produce (fill) the graph nodes from the closest node to the furtherest node. At a later stage we will introduce UI/UX to allow users to change the flow orders and block/open up flows between parts.

Version 2026.1.2.3232
Started initial pass for rendering multiple objects within an ecotype for ground clutter.
Added debug meshes for text letters ABCDE.
Removed shared memory LOD count accumlation from ground clutter evaluation shader, the performance benefit was negligible and it only complicates things for multi-object support.
Added support for multiple objects per ground clutter ecotype. These are different meshes belonging to the same family of clutter and are rendered with their own set of LODs in one draw submission.
Added two clutter object types to Luna, one renders numbers 1 to 5 depending on LOD and the other renders letters A to E depending on LOD. Commented out by default. For now, the distribution shader picks randomly between one of the two object types and is hardcoded to pick between only two, this will be changed in the future.
Fixed computing the prefix sum for ground clutter LODs inside the reordering shader, which was very dumb as this could not synchronized between workgroups and caused objects to flicker.
Added compute shader for calculating the prefix sum of the all LODs for all object types. Currently this brute forces the prefix sum in a single thread which is fast enough for now but will need improving if we have many ecotypes with many object types.
Fixed missing barrier for ground clutter LOD offsets which resulted in rare object flickering.
Fixed missing cleanup of new ground clutter resources on dispose.
Made the TRS sections of the Part/SubPart menus (visible when right clicking on a part in the debug editor) a bit better.
Changed resource graph processing to prebuild processing orders for closest/furtherest first and to consume/produce using these orders.
Removed unncessary debug logging from last commit.
Cleaned up some doubled part symmetry code.
Added symmetrical inheritence functionality to part connectors. Still hunting an issue with connectors not being connected properly but the symmetry is working."
Added part highlighting in flight.
Added part action menu by clicking on highlighted part in flight.
Fixed some problems with some symmetry parts not being cleaned up nicely which could cause big lag.
Added new ImageBarrierInfo and ImageTransition to aid in pipeline barrier usage
Added debug names for image views in ThumbnailRenderer.
Added a generic function for updating and getting descriptor sets in SubPartModel, removing duplicate code.
Fixed Image memory barrier inconsistencies
Fixed buffer barrier for OceanRenderer, PlanetFrustumCulling and partial fix to PlanetRenderer
Changed mouse part hover outside the debug editor to use a different shader for highlighting. Needs some work more still.
Fixed engine gimbal objects not populating from XML correctly.
Fixed engine gimbal transforms having their parent's transform rather than their own.
Added randomized object type selection for ground clutter. For now there are no selection rules or probabilities.
Changed storage buffer read to instance vertex input rate for ground clutter, which should improve performance for meshes with many vertices.
Fixed BuildDrawCommands ground clutter stage only dispatching one workgroup causing some objects to skip rendering.
Added a warning to SimpleVkMeshAtlas if trying to obtain a vertex buffer that does not exist.
Added a means of obtaining the planet renderer's GPUTextureSystem and cloud shadows renderer descriptor set and descriptor set layout. This is used by ground clutter rather than passing all the renderers through to the ecotype data.
Added PBRMaterialReference to ground clutter on the ecotype level. In the future, we'll want to support materials per-object per-LOD, so moving this to the LOD level is the next course of action.
Added rocks to the Moon.
Added 7 test rock mesh variations each with 5 LODs. I am not an artist, I whipped these up in a couple of hours.
Added a diffuse, normal and ORM texture atlas for the new rocks.
The new Moon rocks are now active in XML, meaning enabling the Ground Clutter graphics option (off by default) will now render them.
Fixed connector serializing being completely wrong after fixing a different problem with connector serializing.
The default vehicles are updated with correct connector data.
Added lieft click elsewhere in flight will close all open part windows.
Added Decouple command to part window. Will decouple the part and it's children into a new separate vehicle. This is temporary, eventually will be replaced with actual separator part functionality. Also, will cause a hot mess if you decouple a part with no defined mass. So beware.
Fixed part positioning when creating new vehicles from the vehicle editor (was offsetting incorrectly since the mass changes were made a few weeks ago).
Added a mouse hover highlight color setting to the interface tab of the game settings.
Added small fake force for now when parts decouple.
Modified part left mouse button to open the part menu to be right mouse button and added some auto-closing logic. Pinning menus is on the TODO list.
Added rotation and scale variation to ground clutter, currently hardcoded to break up the uniformity.
Increased frustum culling sphere radius to prevent pop-in.
Updated the Core Propulsion Set A asset XML to signify they use a heat map.
First pass on dragging parts from the spawn menu in the editor. Still need to fight ImGui to give me back my scroll wheel while the ImGui button is in an 'activated' state.
Added dynamic gimbal states for all sub parts with defined gimbals.
Compute and store gimbaled thrust location and direction on each nozzle state.
Added the ability for the flight computer to issue gimbal commands. At the moment it doesn't do anything - control will come in a separate commit.
Fixed locations of several debug visualizations and effects that hadn't been updated for center of mass shift.
Fixed the camera distance zoom changing when you decouple parts so it stays at the same distance before decoupling and just shifts it's focus to the new shifted center of mass.
Fixed write-after-read synchronization issue in planet renderer UV offsets CopyBuffer command.
Fixed write-after-read synchronization issue in planet frustum culling count reset FillBuffer command.
Fixed barrier sizes for RenderableVertexBuffer and RenderableNormalBuffer set to VK_WHOLE_SIZE when we just need to cover the vertex count for the current frame.
Fixed write-write synchronization issue when building a SimpleVkMeshAtlas.
Fixed camera repositioning in editor when radius and/or center of mass change.
Your mouse wheel is no longer apprehended by ImGui until you release the mouse button when you spawn a part in the editor.
Added ground clutter shadow casting support. The shadows won't yet be visible because the terrain shadowmap uses too high a bias and too low a resolution to represent the ground clutter.
Added XML attributes to ground clutter LODs for LOD selection customization. WIP.
Added automatic LOD selection using screen bounding sphere size. This means LOD selection is now not only distance based but is now distance, FOV and screen resolution dependent.
Added bounding sphere size per sub mesh to SimpleVkMeshAtlas.
Fixed ground clutter frustum culling not respecting the new bounding sphere radius.
Fixed some doubling of symmetry data when handling recursive symmetry.
Added a Preload to ModLibrary mods so that definition XML files can be preloaded for the game startup screen.
Changed the game startup menu to now allow you to select the system by dropdown (existing options of Sol, Earth and Moon, and Earth only).
Changed the game startup menu to now allow you to select the starting vehicle and location from dropdown menus. This allows you to start the game with a different vehicle focused/controlled and from any available location (including on the ground).
For now - you can't do this with the Kittens on EVA, we need to do more work to get them to walk first before we enable this.
Changed the game startup menu to now have a "start KSA" button that you must click to start the game.

Fixed vehicle constructors so that we are not unnecessarily converting quaternion to euler and back again in some use cases.
Fixed the principal axes frame solver freaking out for isoinertial or axisymmetric cases.
Fixed vehicle editor updating vehicle configuration on every frame. Also fixed vehicle editor copying tank states every time something connected or disconnected.
Improved handling of singular cases in the asymmetric Euler-Poinsot solver. This was presenting as an unexpected sudden rotation when decoupling parts in certain configurations with low (but nonzero) body rates.
Added mass and tank info to part window for each part.
Added basic ground clutter placement parameters to Astronomicals.
Added ground clutter placement loading from XML.
Changed ecotype data to a uniform buffer from a storage buffer.
Fixed a crash when spawning a new part and then attempting to snap it to a vehicle without dropping it first.
Fixed rendered subpart flat list data not being updated causing parts that are not yet fully (dis)connected to a vehicle to not render correctly.
More cleanup and rationalization of Vehicle constructors.
Added real time ground clutter editing to the terrain debug GUI.
Removed debug logging for the ground clutter cube cell grid.
Added clarification for missing BVH if raytracing is supported and used for ground clutter, where no BVH is required.
Created PartComponent and PartComponentList as a start to formalizing the state update pattern that is emerging in PartTree. This aims to decrease the amount of wheel-reinvention that needs to happen for each new kind of part behavior while preserving our performance and thread safety properties. Additional related utilties are still needed to regularize serialization/creation and the worker thread half of temporary state update.
Deleted RocketNozzleList and replaced it with PartComponentList as a first example case.
Consolidated several different rendering-related structs into a single RocketNozzleFxState.
Fixed Debug Editor OnFrame occurring before the camera updated causing gizmos to render for the previous frame's camera position.
Fixed an ordering issue with the debug editor camera when the center of mass changes causing the camera to jerk for a frame.
Reworked symmetrical editing to account for multiple niche cases. Need to do some clean up and more testing but this should be a bit more robust.

Added fade-in for ground clutter objects entering the render distance. The render distance is a sphere, in the future objects will have some distance jitter applied so they become less densely populated further away. Objects currently do not fade out when leaving this range.
Ground clutter generation range from XML is now read during instance evaluation, was previously a hardcoded cutoff.
Replaced ecotype info buffers' defining each property in each shader with a unified EcotypeData struct.
Updated VRAM estimation for ground clutter resources. VRAM usage per ecotype is now logged at startup.
Changed ResourceManager to use the stack for a bunch of temp arrays and MemoryOwner optimized for flow paths.
Changed the universe's running global Id to start at 1 so we have an invalid/guard value of 0. Also added explicit reset function for when resetting the universe so no one forgets to use Interlocked.

Added ability to refill tanks in the part menu in the vehicle editor.
Added more rocks to the Moon.
Lowered vertex counts for ground clutter rocks LOD4 and LOD5.
Fixed ground clutter LOD selection using raw distance and not camera-z.

Added build new vehicle option to the File menu that will start the Vehicle Editor to allow you to construct and spawn a new vehicle.
Moved Launch site information from main Vehcile Editor UI to a separate UI window.

Version 2026.1.9.3293
Fixed those dastardly planetary collisions with the Erosion modifier. See below note for AMD/Intel GPU users.
Adjusted BC4 (and BC5) CPU decoding to match the NVIDIA standard. AMD and Intel decode these slightly differently (of course they do) so planetary collisions MAY be slightly inaccurate for users running AMD/Intel GPUs. Looking for feedback on this.
Fixed missing biome control weight normalization in HeightFuncs.glsl which was present on the CPU version.
Bumped Earth erosion modifier octaves from 6 to 7 (ha ha) as it makes the nearby mountain terrain look more pleasing. With the fixed erosion modifier collisions, we can do this now.
Removed tiling heightmaps from the CPU height functions as it will be added back as a modifier in the future.
Added hotkey for save/load menu. It currently uses current context to decide which save/load menu to open.
Added ability to focus the camera on a part in the editor. Default keybind is 'f'.
Fixed a vulkan buffer disposal error in SubPartSelectedRenderer.
Added more mod preload checks into a number of data reference classes for safety sakes.
Cleaned up the Vehicle Editor UI a bit, split the parts window into a separate window.
Fixed Camera position after you launch a new vehicle.
Reorganized generic part component classes to make typed aggregates nested classes of the components themselves. This significantly reduces the number of places that generics have to be specified by the end user and makes it possible to more cleanly group the typed lists into top-level untyped collections.
Split PartComponentStateful off of PartComponent to avoid creating a bunch of useless junk for stateless components.
Created PartComponentStateList to store part component states of any type in a single collection.
Created PartComponentStateUpdaters to provide updates for any part component type in the thread worker.
Converted Rocket into a PartComponent.
Added Game Type to the game startup UI. Options for now are: Sandbox and Testing. Testing is what we are used to, with a bunch of prebuilt vehicles already spawned in the game. Sandbox will create a new game with no vehicles at all. You can then go and build a vehicle via the File Menu - Vehicle Editor and launch that vehicle.
Refill the tanks on a new vehicle when launching from the vehicle editor.
Fixed issue in vehcile editor when constructing new vehicle was being done on the ground and the camera was colliding with the non-visible terrain.
Ensure each new vehicle you build has a unique name otherwise bad things happen.
Fixed issue where vehicle editor UI windows were not spawning inside the main viewport on first appearing.
Added ability to Rename a Vehicle and handle System registration dictionary as well.
Added ability to name new vehicles you are building in the vehicle editor.
Fixed stack issues on ResourceManager, change stackalloc to SpanOwner.

Version 2026.1.4.3299
Fixed vulkan validation errors from ground clutter device meshes not being disposed.
Fixed vulkan validation error from ground clutter LOD fade buffer not being disposed.
Added new XML attribute to MeshFileReference: "HostOnly", defaults false, which creates a mesh on the CPU only.
Forced HostOnly to true for ground clutter mesh loading since the individual LODs are not needed on-device - only the atlas.
Converted Gimbals to PartComponents.
Converted stackalloc thruster pulse times to SpanOwner.
Made exponential moving average into a library function.
Added an all-states iterator for a user-specified selection of components.

Version 2026.1.5.3309
Created an UpdatePartComponent step to begin to separate the physics update from the internal vehicle update logic.
Moved RocketCore and RocketNozzle update logic from the physics loop to Rocket.UpdateRockets.
Moved ResourceManager from RocketNozzle to RocketCore to increase the separation between core (internal) and nozzle (external) association.
Added propellant mass flow rate to nozzle and core readouts.
Fixed very excessive propellant usage due to a sign flip in the consumption logic.
Created FxTemperature part component to drive emission and thin film intereference maps. For the moment, this is driven purely from nozzle temperatures.
Added FxTemperature component to SubParts with models and components that support it.
Removed ResetState() method from PartComponentStateful as it was no longer needed.
Fixed a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing, added a few bugs with higher order symmetrical editing. Swapping between symmetry orders with multiple layers of symmetry inheritence is still a bit touch and go. All in all, going in the right direction.
Use PartComponent.TryGetFrom() in a few places where it's less verbose and updated some related doc comments.
Added a method to get mutable access to part component states for serialization and UI-context modification.
Fixed a case where part components would incorrectly think that they couldn't be updated, leading to emissive maps not working.
Improved behavior of temperature emissivity sim, especially for engines at low throttle.
Increased maximum temperature for thruster emissive by 1.75 times.

Version 2026.1.6.3329
Increased thruster emissive intensity.
Merged Part and SubPart classes. This should allow us to simplify quite a bit of logic doubling. This is not meant change the player-facing functionality of Part vs SubPart in the game. Quite a bit of clean up is still needed and given the wide reaching changes unintentional regressions should be expected.
Return individual TStates and TFxStates by reference instead of by value from PartComponentStateful.StateList.
Added individual component and state getters to PartComponentStateful.StateUpdater to match the interface of PartComponentStateful.StateList.
Moved the Tank processing from the old TankList to the new PartComponent/State system.
Made hot path initialization for type updaters infallible to avoid the infectious complexity of null checking in the vehicle update task.
Removed the isEditorUpdate flag for vehicle updates which no longer has a purpose.
Created an InertMass part component and shifted readers to use that instead of the template.
Added in missing part components from top-level parts.
Removed unused PartTree.TotalSubstanceStorageVolume.
Moved one last mass template reader over to the part component.
Converted engine and thruster controllers into part components.
Created a GetSubtreeComponents() function to iterate over all part components of a given type for a part and its sub parts.
Fixed a few accessors in PartComponent.List which weren't returning the concrete component type correctly.
Return sub parts as a span instead of a collection.
Removed thruster/engine controller properties on PartTree.
Converted the subtree components generator into a ref struct enumerator to avoid allocation and used it in an additional place.
Removed some redundant code left over from tanks moving to part components.
Moved some PartTree functionality out of the Part class into the PartTree class.
Added a Split function to the PartTree class.
Tightened access to the Parts list in PartTree so that it must go through PartTree functions so we can eliminate logic errors where other code outside this class could change the Parts list in the PartTree without performing other related logic in the PartTree.
Changed the public Parts collection in PartTree to be a readonly span.
Made the static part list on PartTree private.
Marked two PartTree lists as readonly.
Use GetSubtreeComponents() for inert mass display.
Fixed some pipelines being mislabelled as 'Byte[]'
Fixed potential issue in Physics IntegrateVelocityVerlet where mass properties were not set for initial state causing a mismatch between first derivatives and half-step derivatives.

Version 2026.1.3.3335
Add planetary rings. Sort and render parts of the rings correctly before/after atmospheres and clouds. Make rings affect sunflares. Sample celestial shadows on rings.
Add initial rings config for Saturn and a ring texture
Add initial config for Pan since it orbits inside the rings
Add missing barriers to the planet transparencies renderer
Add a volumetric effect to the rings rendering at limited distances when inside the ring. Ring meshes are still WIP and not yet merged
Use same lighting model for 2d and volumetric rings for seamless transitions between both and to simulate some effects like thicker areas of the ring appearing darker than thinner areas when looking at the non-lit side of the ring. In other words light filters through the ring realistically even on the 2d version
Take advantage of the simple ring geometry to find analytic solutions for the light path and scattering integrals. Use analytic light density when raymarching to improve volumetric rendering performance, use approximate scattering integral for the 2d ring to perfectly match the volumetric effect and seamlessly transition between them
Custom capped cylinder intersection functions to avoid precision issues from more optimized versions found online
Fix volumetricExhaustRenderer failing to hot reload shaders
Prototyped volumetric eclipse shadows on rings, some accuracy issue with the volumetric shadows remain to fix
Add upscaling to volumetric ring
Change depth resolve modes for transparencies from max to min to fix issues with volumetric rings with MSAA, this seems fine so far but ideally we'd use a custom checkerboard depth resolve
Add procedural "detail" lines to rings to avoid passing in very high-res ring textures
Add ring shadows on planet shaders (planet and distantPlanet), still have to sample them on the atmospheres
Simplify setup of distant sphere rendering using bindless
Fixed an error where vehicle mass properties were being computed when the part component states were zeroed out.
Reverted extra mass properties recalculation in the velocity verlet integrator.
Removed the preserved states dictionary concept and pass the old state list directly. This also removes the ClearInto() method which was causing users to do convoluted and error-prone things when attaching and/or detaching parts.
Renamed UpdateDerivedValues to ReinitializeDerivedValues to emphasize how expensive it can be.
Made several PartTree methods private, one of which was being called inappropriately.
Added first pass on generic part component save data. Currently only being used by tank resources but will be expanded.
Fixed broken universe save/load due to generic vehicle save data. You can now save and load the universe again.

Version 2026.1.4.3345
Added PartDecoupler part component class. Doesn't function yet, but stay tuned - it soon will.
Added PartDecoupler component to existing interstage fairing parts.
Changed Decoupler part component, it does not need to be stateful.
Created a PartTree.Merge to accompany PartTree.Split and made the two methods roughly symmetric in how they operate.
Changed vehicle editor snapping to use screen space instead of assembly space.
Moved the point of nonzero mass property checks into the physics system instead of the part system to suppress spurious errors.
Changed running Id to be a uint rather than ulong to align with project standards.
Added StageList to PartList. This is used to manage stage assignment of parts in a part list.
Added temporary UI to Vehicle editor for Stage management, with some rudimentary capabilities.
Added a fallback when raycasting towards a newly spawned part in the editor fails.
Fixed spawning a new part not properly resetting 'selected' values of child parts.
Added new part context menu and window. When right clicked, a part will show a condensed context menu including actions such as Decouple, and fuel tank status. A "Window" open will pull the context menu out into a moveable pinned window with further information, and will remain until closed.

Version 2026.2.2.3384
Created an IFollowable interface for Camera to use instead of Astronomical. This prepares the way for following objects that are not direct participants in the celestial sim (e.g. landmarks or other "static" objects).
Created an IRadius interface and consolidate MeanRadius/ObjectRadius/etc. to use this.
Moved MeanRadius off of AstronomicalTemplate and down one level, where appropriate (e.g. not on Vehicle).
Removed the Vehicle backreference from Part. Instead, we pass in the Asmb2Ego frame relationship based on the surrounding context. This removes a layer of state management, eliminiates the possiblity of an inconsistent Vehicle<->Part relationship, and is a significant step towards making PartTree usable outside of Vehicle, e.g. in the editor.
Improved thruster axis assignment logic. This restores kitten EVA thruster control in all axes, but doesn't eliminate the use of suboptimal thrusters on the test vehicles. To do that, we will need a more globally-optimal jet selection logic algorithm.
Moved orbiter-specific position and velocity methods to IOrbiting.
Created VehicleEditingSpace as a container for part trees in the vehicle editor which do not yet have a full-fledged Vehicle. This avoids having to make up data for in-progress vehicles and carefully manage construction/destruction thereof.
Fixed error where a newly-created part in an empty vehicle editor would be invisible, making building rockets from a blank sheet impossible.
Changed VehicleSave to return PartTrees instead of Vehicles.
Moved RefillConsumables(), ComputeBoundingSphereRadius(), and DrawStageWindow() to PartTree.
Removed the CreateBareBones() constructors.
Fixed the vehicle save/load UI in the vehicle editor subsequent to camera following changes.
Gauge components no longer react to the mouse when the mouse should be disabled.
Part highlighting no longer reacts to the mouse when the mouse should be disabled.
Fixed part and subpart UI drawing in vehicle editor to responect the viewport offset.
Added toggle to root part UI in vehicle editor to show resource info for each part tree.
Fixed multiple vehicle save file loading into vehicle editor.
Added ability to change the root part between loaded vehicles onto the root part UI.
Added group numbering to the UI when you show the resource graph.
Fixed a bug in the CreateOrders method that was not dealing with groups correctly when creating the tank lists to draw fuel from.
Fixed fallback object from vehicle editor. When you enter following something other than a vehicle it would not go back to following this object when exiting the editor.
Added first pass on generic part component templates.
Updated Core Fairing A Assets.
Updated Core Passage A and Core Command A Assets.
Fixed when you delete a part in the DEBUG vehcile editor it only deletes that part and it's children. Not the whole part tree.
Updated Core FuelTank A Assets.
Updated Core Service Module A Assets.
Changed resource graph to use instance Ids of the components rather than Tank references. Also eliminates the need for a public Tank constructor.
Updated Core Propulsion A Assets.
Updated Core Propulsion B Assets.
Completed identifier migration from collision mesh to view mesh to make it more distinct from future collision primitive based collision meshes.
Swapped the TFI_Heat texture map channels to give the heat map a higher bit count.
Swapped TFI channel in Mesh.frag to be consistent with DynamicMesh.frag
Modified the several places required to permit propellant tanks on both sub-parts and parts.
Moved Core_FuelTank_A_Prefab_LF3W3HA propellant tank from the sub-part level up to the part level.
Added a .FullPart accessor to Part that returns itself or its parent (if a sub part).
Renamed SubPart items in Tank and ResourceManager since they can now be full parts.
Pass tank states into ResourceManager UI functions rather than keeping a PartTree copy which might become out of sync.
Added ability to launch existing vehicle saves from the File Menu.
Fixed ability to close the Launch Vehicle Menu without actually launching. MAybe not a bug - Cause some might argue you can't cancel the countdown. ;)
Added ability to refill tanks in each part in the debug vehicle editor with a selected combustion substance.
Fixed emissives not being converted to linear for parts.
Changed all resource processing for engines and thrusters to now use their pre-defined substances rather than hard coded CatNip.
Amended all the prebuilt vehicles to include different substances to support RCS thrusters and Main Engines as defined.

Version 2026.2.2.3396
Added engine gimbal controls to the flight computer. When engines are firing and engine gimbal authority in a particular axis exceeds available RCS authority, engine gimbal will take over attitude control.
Select optimal TVC gains using LQR control. Added several new matrix math extension functions to support this.
Fixed auto burn not starting in some cases if the relaxed profile was selected.
Fixed incorrect gimbal offset position when rotation was nonzero.
Render instanced meshes inside planetary rings: Divide the viewable space into chunks culled on the GPU then sample and cull mesh instances for each chunk inside the ring and the view frustum. Assign an instance buffer sized for the maximum instances we can see for the view frustum and current ring configuration. Meshes currently orbit at different speeds depending on their orbits but this is implemented in a temporary way and has a few issues with jittering, and dirfting at high time compression values.
Fade from the ring volumetric effect to meshes
Set a placeholder config of rocks inside saturn rings, use existing lunar rock model. Current rocks have a shading model that doesn't blend/fade perfectly with the ring's look or Saturn's rings being made of ice particles, a differet shading model for ice particles will be added
Use LODs on the ring meshes similar to the ground clutter system, not using a unified instance buffer and LOD sorting yet so VRAM usage is higher than it needs to be at the moment
Use NormalizeOrZero in the clouds shadow volume to harden against some divisions by zero
Added de/serialization of Stage info into vehicle/game saves.
Fixed game crash if you start one of the game settings where there are no planets with rings.
Part diffuse maps are now KTX2 rather than DDS.
Added feedforward gains to the flight computer TVC controller which eliminates the vast majority of overshoot.
Use output engine throttle to compute gains rather than input engine throttle.
Fixed typo in part game data XML file.
Fixed empty ID in log message when loading instances of situation templates.
Part normal maps are now KTX2 rather than DDS. Please do not curse me with inverted normals.
Added ability to change part stage via part menu in the debug vehicle editor.
Added logic to automatically increase the vehicle stage number when connecting parts that contain a Decoupler component in the debug vehicle editor.
Fixed orbit camera could end up trapped inside a part while clicking. This happened because the clicking action was recorded outside of the previous scope, causing it to not use any drag-safety checks. It would also activate on any type of click, which was not intended.

Version 2026.2.3.3419
Fix jittering and occasional snapping of ring mesh positions/orbits. Some jittering remains in the scale calculation and at high time compression meshes still move through their orbits
Fix ring meshes fadeout forming visible bright edges in some cases when viewed from the dark side of the rings
Fix ring mesh shaders not using hot reload
Part PBR textures now use KTX2 rather than DDS.
Fixed right clicking in the editor turning off selection rather than highlight.
Changed how emissive maps were being handled in the shader to make them a bit less obtuse.
Fixed the circularize at periapsis function for the transfer planner not returning an answer for hyperbolic orbits.
Fixed auto burn not going into alignment mode when the vehicle has RCS on board. This was broken during the TVC update.
Removed GetSubtreeComponents enumerator.
Added a SubtreeComponents list to Part for easy access to all components from a part and its sub-parts.
Added concept of a component being active in stage or not.
Added de/serialize of active status for components.
Added ability to toggle active status for engines and thrusters via part context window.
Decoupler component now decouples when activated.
Added concept of currently active stage to the StageList.
Added ability to activate next stage on the currently controlled vehicle via the space bar.
Changed the sim speed to normal speed when you launch a new vehicle.
Changed physics processing to identify if engines or thrusters are active or not and not use them when not active.
Fixed same issue with game crashing with no planets with rings when the renderers are rebuilt (changing resolution, etc).
Improve flight computer performance and visualization when one or more axes lack authority.
Incrementally remove parts from split tress rather than rebuilding the entire thing.
Fixed one of the few bugs related to radial symmetry order level swapping when inheriting symmetry. Still a few more issues to hunt down here.
Fix a case where part state indexes could get corrupted during removal.
Enable the use of WASD while the flight computer is in an auto attitude mode. This will temporarily override the flight computer's target angle and rate in the given axis with the player's input, allowing e.g. steering adjustments on ascent while letting the computer keep stability control. The DIRECT and PULSE buttons change the magnitude of the override angular rate.
Removed the auto attitude lockout system and message.
Fixed a case where auto burn would not ignite if one more axes have no RCS authority.
Hide orbit lines for landed/splashed vehicles.
Fixed copy/paste error for landed orbit hiding.
Renamed NUL ROT to RATE in the attitude control panel to indicate its new function as the rate hold mode, of which null rotation is the special case with no manual input.
Added a duty cycle metric to nozzles to differentiate between a constant level of low thrust vs. a pulse-width-modulated actuation. This fixes rocket engine exhaust plume flickering when at low throttle and moderate time compression.
Changed the current time update in Universe so that GetElapsed*() is now consistent with the data available to the rendering thread. The next sim step is cached and applied when the worker threads complete.
Added Universe.GetLastSimStep() which is the SimStep that was used to compute the sim data available to the rendering thread.
Fixed planetary ring rock jitter caused by the difference between sim time and render time.
Fixed problem where staging can cause an exception when the vehicle splits.
Added an option to show gimbals in the engine debug window.

Changed default flow rule for engines to be furtherest to nearest tank - only in same stage as the engine.
Fixed the UI draw flow graph to actually draw correctly based on the selected flow mode.
Fixed stage highlighting in the debug vehicle editor getting undone by mouse hover highlighting.
Fixed flow graph drawing in the debug vehicle editor.
Added logic to set stages on parent parts up to decouplers to match engine stage when attaching an engine in the debug vehicle editor.

Fixed potential infinite fuel scenario where an engine has no tanks available to it (due to flow rules) but the vehicle still has the fuel the engine uses.
Fixed deserialize of engine active bool when loading vehicles from saves.
Fixed the two test vehicles "rocket" and "Gemini7" to have their main engine active when loading the game.
Moved the enforcement of maximum gimbal angle from the flight computer to the simulation.
Added an XML specification for maximum gimbal angles in the Y and Z directions. We no longer create components for gimbals with zero maximum angle.
Made it possible to add game data to sub part instances.
Increased maximum WASD slew rate from 30 deg/s to 45 deg/s.
Changed TransformReference to have nullable fields so we can tell the difference between an identity value and an unset value.
Removed PartConnector template reference and cached important transform variables to avoid calling through to the expensive template versions.
Changed the order of the stabilization toggle function. If the flight computer is set to track a specific target, the first toggle will now drop to RATE mode in that same frame. The second toggle will set attitude control to MANUAL.
Major overhaul of the auto-warp logic internals. We now interpolate between the start and end times of the warp with smootherstep, which means all auto-warps take exactly the same amount of player time and end precisely where they are targeted to.
Added a three-second margin when auto-warping to planned burns.

Made the reset simulation flag to AutoWarpStop() mandatory so users are forced to consider the correct behavior in their context.
Fixed planet map exporter validation errors.
Added cubemap support to the planet map exporter.
Converted the Moon heightmap to a cubemap.
Completed cubemapping support for the planet texture exporter. Now exports normal maps in the planet's latitude/longitude aligned tangent frame which allows us to continue using 2-channel normals.
Added back gradient and mip calculation for heightmap cubemaps.
Added back bicubic height sampling for cubemaps.
Adjusted the heightmap sampling in the ocean shader to respect the new cubemaps.
Adjusted how gradients were calculated for the heightmap sample in the ocean shader to respect the new height cubemaps.
Added cubemaps for Earth normal, Moon height, Moon normal, Moon biome Id and Moon biome control textures.
Fixed Earth normal map containing gradients around shoreliens creating mountains that don't actually exist. This means the Starbase OLM A launch site is now flat.
Adjusted CPU side height and normal sampling to work with the new cubemap textures. Terrain collision should still be accurate, more testing needed.
Updated Venus terrain, colour and normal maps. It just uses the Moon's surface textures for now.
Added guards against non-cubemap textures in Celestial.cs.
Added "EmptyNormalCubemap" and "CubemapTemplate", replaced "EmptyCubemap" with a white cubemap texture.
Fixed not defaulting to empty cubemaps properly if a planet texture is null.
Fixed mismatching tangent space construction for planet normal mapping and terrain collisions.
Added cubemap support to the distant sphere shader.
Removed unused ground clutter rock atlas texture.
Converted all other planet textures to cubemaps. Note since most of these are low-res placeholders, they may still have some polar distortion since I just converted them from equirectangular to cubemap.
Removed old non-cubemap planet textures.
Reduced Mars erosion amplitude and allowed it to be stronger on shallower slopes.
Added error if a planet texture is not a cubemap.
Removed unused tiling heightmap references from the astronomicals XML. These will become a modifier in the future.
Fixed seam in Phobos' height texture.
Fixed distant sphere renderer falling back to non-cubemap textures for missing diffuse and normal references.
Cleaned up outdated DecodeBc1Normal function in Celestial and marked other unused functions as old to be removed but kept for now in case I need to refer back.
Completed cubemap conversions. Planet terrain quality will be more uniformly distributed around the planet and issues at the poles are largely resolved, but there will still be a couple outliers until I fix them up. Performance may have improved with the move to cubemaps since they let us sample the planet textures more efficiently and with a better cache hit rate since screen derivatives no longer inflate massively at the poles. Terrain collisions should be accurate.
Increased Earth's maximum elevation by 4 meters to prevent launch sites from being slightly flooded.
Reverted my previous change that permitted negative orbit inclinations in the XML. Inclination must be [0, PI] - if it were negative, then the ascending node would actually be the descending node. Negative inclinations will now be flipped to positive.
Fixed an error where auto-burn could fail to ignite if the vehicle was at the edge of its angle deadband in both pitch and yaw.
Made the Set Orbit debug window input angles more forgiving by wrapping instead of clamping.
Consolidated orbital angle handling into a common set of functions.
Removed the requirement for RCS roll control in deciding whether the vehicle should point before igniting engines during an auto burn.
Fixed the 'focus' button in the editor.
Add de/serialize of Active stage on vehicles.
Allowed PartComponent templates to have no ID. If there is more than one of that type of PartComponent it will need an ID for saves to work correctly.
Modified generic Part TemplateData and SaveData so they can nicely customize their XML representations.
Fixed error in building resource graphs missing the kitten backpack tanks (or any root part that has tanks).
Changed Thrusters for now to default to nearest to futherest flow rule for now.
Added ability to set vehicle template vehicles (the pre-built test vehicles) stage on startup.
Fixed non-block compressed textures with mip levels getting downsampled rather than using the closest mip level when texture size limits are on which was causing sampling errors.
